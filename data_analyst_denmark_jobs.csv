Are you a detail-oriented, curious and data-driven problem solver, who wants to build up a data platform for reporting and analytics in a multinational fast growing fintech company? -then look no further, as this might be exactly the challenge you´re looking for. We offer you the chance to be a part of a truly international and vibrant company with more than 280 skilled and dedicated employees worldwide, who are all passionate about creating next-generation mission-critical financial services infrastructure and leading the rise of a super-correspondent banking network.

The position and why we need you
At Banking Circle we want to make an impact that pioneers the industry and creates instant value for our clients. But we also want to be a best-in-class employer where innovation and career development is going hand in hand. To support both that and our exciting growth journey we are looking to hire a talented Data Engineer, who is eager to participate in building the next generation of our data platform, on the Azure cloud.
The data engineering team owns our existing data platform, which is closely coupled to our legacy payment processing system. As the whole system landscape is being replaced with state-of-the-art services, more and more data sources is coming online and will increase the need for a new decoupled and near real time data platform across all data assets. This is the data platform that we are building to support Banking Circles ability to enter the next level. Your tech stack will include Python, Azure functions, Databricks, Delta Lake on Azure Data Lake storage, Azure SQL (synapse), Tableau (PowerBI) and Terraform for infrastructure as code, but the stack will continuously evolve.

Key Responsibilities
•     Build our Data Platform in python in collaboration with peers
•     Interact with product owner and other stakeholders to clarify requirements/needs
•     Participate in short and sweet team rituals (planning, stand-up and retrospective)
•     Contribute to continuous improvement of the team's ways of working
•     Take responsibility for own learning and development

Skills & Qualifications
Building a data platform on cloud isn´t something that many people have done and especially not for financial institutions. This role will therefore involve a lot of learning and interesting problem solving, while having fun on the journey. To be the right candidate we expect you to have a demonstrated capability from a similar role, where you have gained at least 2 years of experience building data platforms for reporting and analytics and the ability to tackle this kind of complexity head on.As a person you have an infectious can-do-attitude, a growth mindset and the courage to try new things. If you have experience with PowerBI or Terraform it would be an advantage, otherwise you can pick it up in the process. You have an educational background within computer science, engineering or similar field (BSc level as a minimum). We furthermore expect you to be a dependable and knowledge-sharing team-player that cooperates well at all levels of an organization. As Banking Circle is an international company, it is a requirement, that you are fluent in English, both verbally and in writing. The position will be based at Banking Circle’s office in Copenhagen.

Join Banking Circle

As we will be conducting interviews continuously we urge interested candidates to reach out as soon as possible.

With our passion for exploring the boundaries of what is possible, it is sometime tempting to take a leap of faith. We’re looking for a team member who can challenge us, when it comes to pursuing the facts we base our decisions on.

Your team
You become a part of an agile, high-performing team consisting of highly skilled engineers scattered across Brande and Aarhus. We provide pipelines and platforms optimizing the delivery times and ease of operation for the developer teams across all of BESTSELLER . We do this in close collaboration with the developer teams, assisting them on their journey towards end-to-end responsibility of their applications. We are aiming for multi-cloud and are currently utilising two of the three major cloud providers – Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Despite our size and capacity, we act more like a start-up with rapid decision-making processes and room for experimentation. We are ambitious and move fast from thought to action.

Your job
Your primary purpose is to shed light on the business trade-offs between speed, cost, and quality, enabling us to make enlightened, data-driven decisions on our cloud journey. You do so by developing tools that help us understand our products and solutions better. Together with our stakeholders, you make the data understandable for them to build more efficient solutions.

Your tasks may include:
Deep diving into behavioral data and information from our own and BESTSELLER’s users and applications.
Coding small helpful applications to increase efficiency.
Teaching colleagues how to utilize the data to increase their productivity.
Daily development and operations of the development pipeline together with the team.


Your Benefits
A wide interface across BESTSELLER, significant task variety and the freedom to go wherever your curiosity and imagination takes you in a team that is just as much R&D as it is engineering.
We work with the full development pipeline, and if you are into CI/CD, cloud-native solutions, Kubernetes, scaling, observability or other novel technologies, our team is the perfect place to be.
In this newly established role, you will have a unique chance to shape and grow in your own job – supported by a team who is eager to share their knowledge.

Your profile
You know Python or R – and are experienced working with datasets in machine learning studies. What matters most to us, is that you have an analytical and data-driven approach to work and enjoy finding patterns in chaos. With your keen eye for detail, you excel when it comes to finding ways to optimize costs and increase efficiency.
You thrive in a role with a high degree of task diversity and ties to various parts of our business. With a cross-collaboration attitude and solid communication skills, you establish and develop relations between teams and departments.

We look forward to hearing from you
If you have any questions about the position, feel free to reach out Lars Hjørnholm on +45 27958554. If not, please send us your CV and application as soon as possible and no later than 1st of July 2021.

17,Data Scientist for Advanced Analytics & AI,Telenor,"Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark",2 alumni work here,"Do you have extensive technical and commercial knowledge to design innovative solutions for customer needs? Do you have end to end expertise in extracting insights from data using cutting edge data science techniques? And you strong in collaborating with stakeholders to identify & execute upon data science use cases? Then you might be our new Data Scientist!

“My team and I get to explore and structure vast amounts of data and provide insights – therefore being a respected and trusted expert partner for the rest of the company. As well as the rest of the company, we really care about the customer and how we can further maintain and develop the safe and secure position we have taken. Therefore, we continuously challenge ourselves on our data science techniques and our collaboration to make the highest possible impact”, says Head of Advanced Analytics & AI, Mansoor Ali Malik

Data insights using cutting edge data science techniques, collaboration, and execution – what’s not to love?

Connecting data insights with the right people, who can make decisions and execute for great value for our customers, is where we see a huge potential. The desired results circle around building knowledge through data and preparing recommendations and machine learning models to improve customer lifetime and value. Furthermore, coordinate with Technology division and engineering teams to develop CI/CD pipelines that will enable a continuous feedback loop of data-based customer lifecycle management.

Therefore, the main tasks within this position will surround:
Develop and apply data wrangling and data science techniques in all scales from data management and transformation to working solutions in production.
Access information from a range of data stored in disparate systems, integrating data, and providing data mining to answer specific business questions as well as identifying unknown trends and relationships in data.
Understand customer needs and provide data recommendations to improve business performance. Have consultancy mindset to deliver more than expected.
Experience and interest in ML Ops techniques and open source solutions available in the market.
Knowledge about data security policy.
You balance deep data knowledge with a collaborative mindset – and thrive on being part of a fast-moving environment!

On the personal level we all have our competency preferences and yours should start with the deep data knowledge. However, to really be a fantastic connection and provide value to the customer, you need to have a collaborative mindset and communicate with stakeholders effectively to really make the highest impact. Luckily the company has a strong history of collaboration and building strong relationships across teams/divisions to solve complex issues and tasks – but of course everyone has a responsibly to create and maintain these relationships.

On a professional level, competencies which will be an advantage are fx:
3 to 5 years of experience in building models and insights through data.
Knowledge of a wide range of data science techniques (supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning etc.) and algorithms and ability to design the best solutions for specific business needs.
Telenor is considering containerization and CI/CD pipeline for data science model deployment and productionization so experience in ML ops using Kubernetes, Airflow, Git is a plus.
Hands on experience with Apache Spark, Jupyter notebook and Python for building models and recommendations.
Working knowledge with APIs to deliver data to other applications for personalized customer journeys in digital and traditional channels.
Who Are We

?

The Advanced Analytics & AI team is placed in the Consumer (B2C) division within the Brand & Marketing team, but has a shared responsibility to serve the whole organization. This means the connection from data insight to execution in terms of marketing campaigns and products is very strong. The ambition is to execute very fast from the insights you provide and making an impact in the market. This is at the core of the Advanced Analytics & AI team.

The team is based in Frederikskaj 8 at the Telenor main office. The official language is Danish, but fluency in English is an advantage since your future leader understands Danish but speaks English.

As a place of work, we have focus on creating fantastic connections between each other and our customers. With the newest solutions and the most effective network, we create small miracles in a world that never sleeps.

As people we are straightforward and develop each other. We challenge ourselves and the market by moving in new directions with our innovative way-of-work and technologies. We are the digital backbone, which connects people, companies, and the societies we are a part of.

Director - Analytics and Intelligence at VENZO Analytics A/S - Data-driven business transformation
Send InMail
Ambitiøs Senior Data Engineer søges til BI & Analytics Gazelle-virksomhed 

Kan du noget helt særligt inden for Datawarehouse og BI? Har du erfaring med Microsoft Power BI, Power Platformen, Azure og SQL – og kunne du tænke dig arbejde med nogle af Danmarks største virksomheder? Så er det dig, vi søger! 

VENZO Analytics søger ambitiøse Senior Data Engineers til en hurtigt voksende BI og Analytics virksomhed. Vi har kontor i København NV og Aarhus og arbejder med:  

Data warehouse modernisering og migrering til Azure  
BI migrering fra Tableau, Qlick og TARGIT til Microsoft Power BI   
IT Service Management (ITSM) og Financial Analytics   
Demokratisering af data og BI self-service 
Analytics og visualisering i Microsoft Power BI og Power Platformen  
BI og datastrategi. 

Hertil har vi udviklet et koncept, der integrerer datavidenskab og psykologi ved datavisualisering med henblik på at styrke ledelsens evne til at træffe beslutninger og skabe forandringer i deres organisation. 

Om dig og dine kvalifikationer  
Du har erfaring med SQL, Data transformation (Data Factory, SSIS, Python) og kendskab til Azure Analytics Services (ADF, SQL DB, Synapse, Azure Storage). Du har en solid forståelse for ’data-kæden’ og motiveres af at kanalisere data frem til analytikerne/Power BI specialisterne ved at udvikle solide grunddata, som de kan arbejde videre med ud mod forretningen. Du er Microsoft certificeret i en eller flere discipliner.   

Det er en fordel, hvis du har erfaring med at modernisere data warehouses ved brug af Azure/Azure Synapse og/eller erfaring med migrering fra Qlick, Tableau eller TARGIT til Microsoft Power BI. Det er yderligere en fordel, hvis du har erfaring med at bygge skalerbare data warehouses til SaaS services – som eksempelvis VENZO Azure Cost Management Service. 
Din tilgang til problemløsning er pragmatisk er agil, og du er vant til at skabe bro mellem forretning og rå datasæt. Du søger konstant at automatisere og forenkle med henblik på skalérbarhed og lettest mulig vedligeholdelse af dataplatform/data warehouse.  

Du har bopæl i Danmark og kan fremvise en ren straffeattest.  

Vi tilbyder en anderledes BI og Analytics arbejdsplads 
VENZO Analytics er en ambitiøs virksomhed med drevne ambitiøse medarbejdere og plads til personlig og faglig udvikling. Vi har det princip, at ”din markedsværdi skal stige gennem dit arbejde, mens du fastholdes gennem trivsel og godt kollegaskab”. Derfor søger vi konstant udfordringer og uddannelse/certificeringer, som gør os selv og hinanden dygtigere. Vi måler os selv i kundernes positive tilbagemeldinger – og sætter en ære i, at vores løsninger gør en markant og mærkbar forskel for kunderne. Denne forskel kan være gennem reducerede omkostninger til cloud infrastruktur eller ved at skabe dashboards, som bliver anvendt til at tage beslutninger samt skabe ændret adfærd hos kunderne. 

Vi søger de absolut bedste – og de bedste i vores perspektiv er dygtige og ambitiøse kollegaer, som forstår at støtte og hjælpe hinanden til at lykkes i fællesskab. Vi er et hold, og vi passer på hinanden. 

Vores omgivelser er uprætentiøse og afslappede. Påklædning varierer fra vandkæmmet hår og jakkesæt til T-shirts og kondisko. Det afgørende er ambitioner, kvalifikationer og evnen til at samarbejde og lykkes i fællesskab. Vi er meget forskellige, men forenet i at lykkes som et hold.  

Om stillingen som Senior Data Engineer og ”Trusted advisor” 
Som Senior Data Engineer vil du indgå som en vital del af vores Analytics team og indgå aktivt i at understøtte leverancer på én eller flere forskellige kundeprojekter. Du vil indgå i et tæt samarbejde med forretningsressourcer både internt i VENZO og hos kunder.  
Projekterne er forskellige og kan variere lige fra migrering og automatisering af et Excel-regneark til modernisering af en global Azure platform. Hertil kommer migrering fra Qlick, Tableu og TARGIT til Microsoft Power BI. Den røde tråd er data warehouse modernisering, BI demokratisering/self-service og datavisualisering (som bygger på psykologiske skoler og fagdiscipliner). Din rolle og fokus vil afhænge af din erfaring, kompetencer og interesser. I det omfang du motiveres af salg, vil du medvirke til pre-sales og tilbudsskrivning. 
 Vi arbejder typisk i teams bestående af en projektleder, Power BI specialist (datavisualisering) og backend specialist (data warehouse, Azure, SQL, SSAS). Ved større projekter bemandes med flere kollegaer, og opgaver/projekter løses selvstændigt/alene eller i mindre grupper. Uanset projektets størrelse, er samarbejde og adgang til kollegaernes input og sparring en afgørende faktor.    
Du vil desuden indgå i rådgivning og vejledning af kunder – og medvirke til at udarbejde BI strategier og beslutningsoplæg til kundernes valg af fremtidig dataplatform. Du forstår således betydningen af rollen som ”Trusted Advisor” og evner at sætte dig ind i kundens behov og forretning, så du kan vejlede og rådgive optimalt.   

Case og præsentation for ledelsen  
I forbindelse med rekrutteringsprocessen, vil du blive bedt om at løse en case. Casen omfatter et dataudtræk og en række spørgsmål, som skal præsenteres og diskuteres med ledelsen i VENZO Analytics.  

Om VENZO 
Som ansat i VENZO kan du se frem til et selvstændigt job med bred kontakt til såvel kunder som hele VENZO’s organisation. Kulturen er dynamisk med en uformel og direkte omgangstone – og du vil i høj grad få mulighed for at sætte dit eget præg på stillingen. Derudover lægger vi stor vægt på, at du løbende udvikler og styrker dine kompetencer, da det er afgørende for VENZO at fastholde et højt fagligt niveau blandt vores medarbejdere. Lønnen afspejler dine kompetencer.  
Hvis du mener, det er dig, vi leder efter, og at du har det der skal til for at blive en del VENZO, så kontakt os nu. Send din ansøgning og CV til os på e-mail hr@venzo.com att.: Mads Liebst – og har du spørgsmål, er du velkommen til at kontakte Director, Mads Liebst på tlf. +45 2578 4028 eller Partner, Søren Anderberg på telefon +45 2029 4673.

30,Senior Data Analyst - Go to Market,Pleo,"Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark",1 alum works here,"Here at Pleo we work on painful problems that we see today and try to solve them with a touch of magic. Our angle to do this is through company spending; we’ve built a product that gives trust and autonomy to all employees: everyone gets a company card and spends company money responsibly. No expense reports. No time wasted. Decentralization of decision making. Delegation through ownership. That's our focus.

Welcome to our Senior Data Analyst role

As a Senior Data Analyst at Pleo you will be responsible for fostering an environment, where decisions are supported by clear analysis and accurate data no matter how big or small. You will help our commercial teams with valuable insights to enable data-driven decision making on a daily basis as well as supporting ongoing projects and long term strategic decision making.

Furthermore you will define metrics and KPI’s, build automated dashboards, reports and advanced models to help teams make better and faster decisions. You will work closely with C-level management in the commercial side of the business including Customer Experience, Sales, Marketing and Finance acting as a consultant and partner to help achieve their strategic goals.

You will thrive in this role if you
Have genuine passion to understand data and the processes and story behind it
Can connect the dots and read in-between the lines and combine statistical and business perspectives to uncover the underlying story in any data
Define and evaluate key metrics and understand what moves them and why
Empower the team to answer data questions quickly and easily by building high-quality ground truth data sets
Have a positive can-do attitude
Are great at communicating clearly and effectively to cross functional partners of varying technical levels
The nitty gritty skills needed
5+ years working experience with SQL.
Experience in data modelling for analytical/reporting use

Strong stakeholder management skills
High attention to detail and proven ability to manage multiple, competing priorities simultaneously
Great communicator of analyses and recommendations to cross functional stakeholders for decision making
Experience with more advanced analytics topics such predictive modelling, cohort analysis and regression analysis
Experience with Google Cloud Platform (Bigquery etc) or similar tools
Your colleagues say you
Are very curious to the the story and the people behind the data
Are striving for excellence
Are taking extreme ownership
Empathetic of people and stakeholders
Are a person they would also enjoy having a coffee with (virtual or not)
Work in English with ease (it's our company language)
Show me the benefits!
Your own Pleo card (no more out-of-pocket spending)
Flexible working remote options for those onsite (just speak to your team)
Quarterly trips to somewhere for team camps (both company-wide ones and team-specific ones). The last one was in Northern Ireland in December (2019)
Investment in learning & developing (just check with your team for what's reasonable, we don't have set budgets)
And here are some other nice gestures that we do
Catered lunch in our HQ and London offices when you're here
25 days holidays (annual)
Loads of weird and wonderful niche communities to join in the company (we're talking guerrilla gardening, liquids tasting, the Pleo band, learning to code initiatives, beer brewing, skiing, Pleo dinners, that type of thing)
Wild enthusiasm and encouragement from us if you want to host MeetUps, events, etc - we'll help (venue, food etc)
Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Through fintech we've seen a way to impact how people work; we think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. Based on some pretty amazing Series B-round investment in 2019, and a Series C-round announced in April 2021, we think we're onto something big.

So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 300+ team, from over 44 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, or Montreal offices – and quite a few full-time remotes in 15 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by sensible things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us we'll help you get up the best remote setup possible, and will fly you in once a quarter for team camps.

Sometimes, we win awards 🤩 🏆

32,"Data Engineers, DataOps",Wolt,"Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark",2 company alumni work here,"DataOps is not a new thing at Wolt, but having a whole team focusing on it is! If you want to be scaling up data collection and usage at a truly data-driven company, you might want to join our brand new DataOps team! 

Wolt has been growing substantially in the past years and this growth has posed new challenges when working with data. We want to make sure that the teams consuming data are able to do so without spending the majority of their time on acquiring, cleaning and transforming it. So this is where DataOps comes to the rescue! 

This team would be responsible for bridging the gap between data integration, data engineering and data documentation, helping other teams to access the right data and shorten the cycle time. In practice you would be working with integrating data from our services into our warehouse and into our internal data catalog and help develop the tooling that makes these operations possible. In addition, the long term goal for DataOps is to help other teams to become more independent with data analysis and data quality, by coaching with tools and practices.

As said, we have projects already up and running, quite complex ones with a few hundred data pipelines so this team will have a lot of impact in shaping the future of DataOps at Wolt. As the team is new, the roles will be shaped based on each team member's background and desire to take responsibility.

The team welcomes a new member to the Helsinki HQ or working entirely remotely in elsewhere Finland, Germany, Denmark, or Estonia now and in the future! 

Our humble expectations

Working in this team means putting both your technical and interpersonal skills into action. If you have been working with data engineering before you probably know your way around data modeling, data warehousing and databases (we use Postgres, MongoDB and Snowflake), without forgetting backend development. This is the kind of experience we are also looking for. Our data platform is mainly built with Python, so you should have experience with it. We also work with Kafka, Airflow, Spark & Kubernetes. 

Helping out other product teams is at the core of this role, so good collaboration and communication skills will be needed. Having a genuine desire for wanting to make data work better for all ensures that you’ll enjoy the role as well. 

Next Steps

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and Wolt stock options. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you'll own a piece of the pie. 

If you want to check up on your application or have any further questions about the position, you can turn to Talent Acquisition Partner Jasmin Shams, jasmin.shams@wolt.com at any given time.

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt works together with over 30,000 restaurant and retail partners as well as with over 60,000 courier partners across 23 countries and 129 cities.

Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest reviews, largely because of our customer-centric approach to how we build our products and operations. For example, our customer service team responds in a matter of seconds, in the customer’s own language.

Now, we’re in scale-up territory, backed by incredible VCs (raising Series B in Feb 2020), and over 100 exceptional Dixaterians working with us in 4 offices (and remotely)🚀

But, there’s also so much more, such as flexible working, autonomy, continuous learning, meaningful work, future planning (family health and retirement) and other bits & bobs (i.e. socials and food).

Our team in Copenhagen is responsible for the development and deployment of the company’s next-generation technology closely collaborating with the company’s other branches in New York and Berlin.

Our team in Copenhagen currently consists of a few veterans from adtech as well as 16 handpicked new highly competent and focused colleagues who have joined since the end of 2016. Among other reasons, many exciting tasks are constantly flowing in from the rest of the organization, so we would like to expand the team with even more creative and clever minds. We are looking for both data engineers and data scientists, but prefer people with a passion for both fields of work.

The Company
LiveIntent, one of the world’s largest people-based marketing platforms, connects 2,500 publishing and advertising brands with over 250 MM verified people every month across all types of media. With the anonymized email address at the center of its industry-leading identity graph, LiveIntent provides brands with solutions that help them monetize, acquire, and retain real people, even where cookies don’t work. LiveIntent enriches a brands’ data, making it possible for them to deepen their understanding of their audiences, and more effectively market to people wherever they are present and paying attention. LiveIntent is home to over 180 people worldwide with offices in New York, Chicago, Berlin, and Copenhagen.

LiveIntent Copenhagen started as a Danish startup company in 2013 and was acquired by LiveIntent in November 2015. We develop and operate both an online, real-time service that receives billions of requests from all over the world and from other LiveIntent components, and an offline, batch-oriented analytical data processing pipeline that prepares data for the online service by processing billions of data points.

During the last six months we have finished the following projects:
Orchestration of our own Hadoop/Spark-clusters as we have grown out of AWS EMR.
Automated tuning of Spark jobs, so that memory usage is adjusted to the current job.
Reduced compile times in Scala code using macros instead of implicit resolution.

We want to have completed the following tasks by the end of 2020:
Automatic configuration of ec2 instance types for Hadoop/Spark clusters, to maximize price and stability.
Scheduling of Hadoop jobs so that we make the most of our clusters and prioritize the most important jobs first.
Use more efficient file formats such as Avro and Parquet.
How do we exchange x amount of Terabyte data with our partners every day in an efficient and robust way?

About the Job
We are looking for a Data Engineer who can design, develop and maintain complex software solutions. You will be able to plan and organize your own schedule to a great extent, but you are expected to be able to work closely with the other developers on the team as well as stakeholders in the company’s international product division.
You will be part of all development phases, from initial discussions and exchange of ideas, to prototyping, development, testing, deployment, maintenance/improvement and reporting, but with expected focus on the final parts.

In the Copenhagen office we believe in freedom and flexibility under responsibility and insist on a high level of competence. Our development process is as a result of that a loosely defined hybrid of agile methods and rapid prototyping. 

Your Profile
You have a couple of years professional experience with software development and are passionate about learning new things. You are interested in back-end technologies and architecture. You may also be interested in math, statistics, machine learning or adtech technology.

You have one of the heavier degrees such as computer science or software engineering. You have practical experience with actual programming, and preferably also have a practical and/or deep theoretical understanding of some of the following:
Data processing in Spark or in MapReduce using Hadoop/Cascading/Scalding
Programming in Scala
Programming in Python
Amazon Web Services
Data reporting and ad hoc analysis in SQL or in the PyLab-suite
NoSQL key value stores configuration and stability (E.g. Project Voldemort or graph databases.
Orchestration in Airflow

You approach problems analytically and solutions pragmatically. You are full of good ideas, able to see opportunities and weaknesses in other people’s ideas, and able to find ways to discuss ideas in a distanced and constructive manner. You love to go in depth with different topics and are curious about learning about things within new subjects. You want to understand and get involved with the problems the company is facing. You thrive in a dynamic environment where work priorities can change, and therefore tasks may not always be finished. You can hand over tasks, but prefer to finish them yourself. You are able to work independently and enterprisingly.

We Offer
You can look forward to being a key player in a challenging and dynamic developmental story where you will be part of a team with some of the industry's hottest talents. There will be rich opportunities to learn from others, and you will have the flexibility to dive into experiments on your own. We are passionate about new solutions, technologies and algorithms, but pragmatic in our choice of solutions.

We believe in freedom and flexibility under responsibility so that office hours can be adapted to your life as long as meetings are covered. If you need to work from home one day, it is completely fine, as long as you live up to what is expected.We are an international company, with frequent contact between the departments in Berlin and New York City. The position is located in our office in Copenhagen.

Does that sound exciting? If so, send us an application. Applications without a resume including a motivation will not be considered.

Dit kommende job

Kreditrapportering og Styring er en central enhed, der blandt andet har ansvar for styring og rapportering af Nykredits kreditrisiko på porteføljeniveau. Det sker ved løbende rapportering af den aktuelle sammensætning og størrelse af kreditrisikoen. Rapporteringen tilgår myndigheder og Nykredits øverste ledelse, og konkret anvendes analyserne til eksempelvis justering af risikospredning på brancher.

Vi leder nu efter en ambitiøs kollega, der kan indgå i teamet omkring porteføljestyringen og blive kollega med nogle af de største kapaciteter inden for analytics og datamining på kreditområdet.

Dine primære ansvarsområder vil være:
Dataleverancer til interne og eksterne interessenter, herunder til brug for myndighedsrapportering
Analytisk arbejde med styring og tiltag på Nykredits udlånsportefølje
Udvikling af datamodeller og scripts – samt anvendelse her. Særligt udvikling og drift af scripts på SAS studio-platform
Medspiller på Nykredits implementering af ny data- og programmeringsplatform.

Dine kompetencer

Du er analytisk og brænder for at omsætte EU-regulering som CRR og nationale regler fra bl.a. Finanstilsynet til konkret kreditrisikostyring. Du er drevet af, at dine leverancer skal være af høj kvalitet og leveres til tiden. Du er bevidst om at bevare overblikket – også selvom en deadline nærmer sig, og så får du energi af at indgå i samarbejde med kolleger i og uden for afdelingen.

Du har en høj faglighed, der sandsynligvis har afsæt i en økonomisk uddannelse på kandidatniveau, og du har erfaring med SAS og Excel. Vi arbejder løbende med nye værktøjer, så du skal være åben for inputs og udvikling på softwaresiden. Du har 2-5 års relevant erhvervserfaring, gerne fra den finansielle sektor.

Bliv en del af vores arbejdsplads

Kreditrapportering og Styring er organisatorisk forankret i det centrale kreditområde for Nykredit koncernen. Du bliver en del af et team med 19 kolleger, der med stor faglighed, kompetence og engagement arbejder med et bredt katalog af opgaver. Den grønne dagsorden fylder mere og mere i vores arbejde, så det har vi en forventning om, at du også har en interesse for.

Er du interesseret?

Søg jobbet online. Har du spørgsmål til stillingen eller Nykredit som virksomhed og arbejdsplads, kontakt underdirektør Hanne Råe Larsen, 24 77 97 76 eller seniorrekrutteringspartner Christian L. Henningsen, 44 55 18 43.

Om os

I Nykredit bliver du en del af noget helt unikt. Udover at vi vil være danskernes foretrukne finansielle partner, vil vi også være en ansvarlig samfundsspiller. Og fordi vi er en del af en forening, der er ejet af vores kunder, har vi helt særlige muligheder og forpligtelser til at give noget tilbage til vores kunder og til samfundet.

Hos Nykredit bliver du en del af en kultur, hvor vi sætter en ære i at være ambitiøse på dine vegne, og vi investerer gerne i din udvikling. Til gengæld forventer vi naturligvis også, at du gør dit bedste for kunderne, forretningen og kollegerne. Forenet kan vi mere.

Nyuddannet, ambitiøs og klar på en vækstrejse?

RE-ZIP blev grundlagt i 2018, vi har udviklet et cirkulært emballagekoncept til e-handlen, der reducerer CO2 udledningen med hele 88%.
Cirkulære emballager bruges indtil de er slidt op, i stedet for at ende i skraldespanden efter kun en gangs brug.
Vi tror på at cirkulær emballage bliver det nye sort indenfor e-handel, vi er førende på området og ønsker at bevare denne position, også når cirkulær emballage bliver det nye normale.
Med RE-ZIP kan kunderne bytte skraldespanden ud med postkassen, når de skal af med deres emballage. Fra postkassen finder emballagerne selv vej til RE-ZIPs retur central, hvor de bliver kvalitetssikrede og rengjorte, inden de igen leveres klar til brug hos webshoppen. – alt sammen understøtte af vores software!

Vores kontor ligger i Aarhus C og vi er nu på jagt efter den helt rigtige person der kan varetage vores fremtidige softwareudvikling, med mulighed for at blive partner og CTO på sigt.

Ansvarsområde:
Du vil få ansvaret for hele vores digitale infrastruktur. På nuværende tidspunkt har vi outsourcet alt software udvikling og vedligeholdelse, men vi vil gerne øge vores inhouse kompetencer og ejerskab på dette område.

RE-ZIP Admin, som er en SQL-database med PHP-interface og API integration med diverse E-comm systemer.
RE-ZIP mobil APP, som er på android og IOS, bygget i Xamarin med integration til vores database
Re-zip.dk, som er en standard WP hjemmeside

Hvem vi søger:
-Du er passioneret og nysgerrig, på at få software til at spille sammen med det øvrig setup for RE-ZIP.
-Du har erfaring med SQL-databaser, PHP-udvikling, mobilapplikationer og API integration.
-Du er klar til at være en del af et projekt i udviklingsfasen, som kræver at du er dedikeret og parat til at lægge en stor arbejdsindsats.
-Det er et plus hvis du kan vise opgaver du selv har lavet uden for skolen.

Dine opgaver:
-Du bliver ansvarlig for at gennemføre udviklingsprojekter i samarbejde med en ekstern arkitekt
-Front- og back end design, udvikling og vedligeholdelse.

To be part of a company that leads the market in sustainable indoor living. We offer you a world of opportunities – if you have the ability and the drive to take them.

Would you like to take up a proactive role where you get to bring your own ideas to the table as you collaborate directly with the colleagues that receive the insights you generate? A role where your reports are the foundation of how we make decisions across the VELUX Group?

Then join us to utilise a wide range of quality data from our supply chain and customer service to elevate our quality performance.

Your challenges

Joining 3 dedicated business analyst colleagues, you will step into our Performance and System Management team in either Østbirk or Skjern. As part of our global quality organisation, we have ownership of our Factory registration systems (Q-DAS and SAP QM) used by our quality inspectors and machine operators across our global production companies and, even more importantly, translating data into valuable insights for the VELUX business.

You will team up with experienced colleague, located in Østbirk or Skjern, to provide our supply organisation and other stakeholders with the reports they need to make data-based decisions. Thus, you will :

Be responsible for development of our Registration System on the factories, including govern the use of the systems.
Proactively interact with quality assurance colleagues to identify their information needs.
Investigate the possibilities for use of Machine Learning based on production data.
Build unique reports and maintain and adjust standard reports in Power BI and SAP Analytics Cloud.

”You’ll function just as much as a consultant as an analyst in this role. If a colleague asks for a specific report, you help identify what opportunities we have to shed light on the subject and come up with your own ideas to make it as useful as possible,” explains Jakob Blichert-Toft, Manager of PSM.

Your Qualifications

It is important that you are just as fond of collaborating with colleagues and creating value for the business as you are of crushing data. We imagine that :

You have experience as a business analyst or that you have obtained a business degree related to BI.
You have a proactive approach to your work and show initiative.
You are a fast learner and a strong collaborator.
You preferably have experience in Power BI and/or SAP Analytics Cloud and/or SAP QM – but it is not a prerequisite.
Your opportunities

You will join a highly self-driven team of colleagues that are good at taking initiative and sharing knowledge. Even though we work from different locations, we meet up on the phone every single morning to discuss tasks and share experiences. This way, you will quickly get a hold of things and feel as part of the team.

Linking production and customer service from a global point of view, you will get a broad interface and interact with colleagues from across the world. Thus, you will establish a great professional network and learn from highly competent colleagues in both your immediate team and within the VELUX organisation.

You will gain hands-on experience with top-of-class data processing in a global company which will give you a solid foundation for your future career as a data specialist.

“This role will give you unique insights into the quality set-up of a global supply chain and customer service organisation, and your analyses will make a huge difference for our decision makers,” finishes Jakob.

Application and contact

If you would like to know more about this opportunity and the VELUX Group, please feel free to contact Jakob Blichert-Toft by telephone +45 7669 3460.

We look forward to receiving your application and CV as soon as possible. We are screening and interviewing on an ongoing basis, so don’t wait to apply!

Our Mission
Our mission is to make rental administration easy for tenants and landlords. Managing rental properties is complicated, whether you’re managing a single property or hundreds. We have developed a platform that removes all the frustrations of being a landlord by leaning on technology, automation and amazing customer service. We want our landlords to spend their time adding value to their portfolios whilst making sure tenants have the best renting experience they can get.
Join our ambitious startup to make a real change in an industry that truly needs it.

Our Engineering Environment
We rely entirely on a serverless infrastructure on AWS. Most of our micro-services are written in Java, based on Clean Architecture and are event-based, using AWS Lambda, SQS, SNS, S3, and DynamoDB.

Our frontend is a React app based on Next.js, styled-components and our own component library built with Storybook – yes, everything is written in TypeScript.

We build our product through a process inspired by experiments. First, we test ideas, job stories and product market fit with a pretotype which is a quick experiment with little software. Once we have an understanding of the jobs-to-be-done and the market we either move on to a prototyping stage with a little more software, or straight to the “real” implementation. We learn a lot during these initial phases while using only limited resources. And we find that this process allows us to move fast and stay agile while giving us a high degree of confidence in the product we deliver. It’s usually not possible in other industries, but in property management everything is handled manually so we are just as good as status quo.

The Product team uses Scrum. You will not be limited to a certain technology or area, but get responsibility across the product, and it is expected that you contribute to the team and use your skills broadly within the product team.

Needless to say, as we process the rent for thousands of homes and offices we are serious about security and privacy.

Competencies 
As a person you thrive in a position where you have a lot of responsibility, work in a small team and also challenge the existing processes, the team, the product and yourself.
Ideally you have:
3-5 years of software development experience in Java and/or Typescript
Experience consuming and creating APIs
Experience with React and Next.js
Experience with (and contributing to) a component library
Experience with different testing strategies (unit testing and manual testing)
Worked with distributed systems and event based architecture
Ability to communicate well about your own code and others code
Some experience with AWS Lambda, SQS, SNS, and DynamoDB is welcomed.
 What we offer you
Join the fastest growing PropTech scale up in Denmark, with an experienced team and backing from the three biggest VCs in Denmark. It is a role with responsibility, influence and opportunities to grow with the company as we go international.

Software Engineer
Are you a technically curious Software Engineer? If you want to work with high-purpose software solutions, this is a chance to join a first movers’ company that combine software, psychology, and machine learning to prevent gambling addiction.

Mindway AI - software for detection of problem gambling
At Mindway AI, we specialize in artificial intelligence software that helps identify and prevent problem gambling. Gambling addiction is a widespread, global challenge and our software supports gambling operators all over the world in detecting patterns and assessing gambling problems among their customers – and ultimately prevent them from becoming addicts.
We have already received awards for our innovative products, for example the Compliance Innovator or Innovation of the Year 2020 & EGR Nordics Rising Star 2020.
Today, we are a team of six colleagues engaged in software development, machine learning, mathematical modelling, data analysis, product innovation, sales, and marketing.
We collaborate with gambling operators of all sizes; some even have global reach and are well-known brands in the industry. Our solutions are currently operational in Denmark and other European countries, and very soon on other continents as well.
To continue our growth and improve our products, we are looking for a self-motivating and innovative software engineer that wants to work with a small team with lots of influence, a modern tech-stack and exciting growth potential. If you are looking for a key role in an innovative company, this could be your next career step.

The position as Software Engineer
As Software Engineer you will help the team ensure that the solutions are resilient, well-tested and scalable but you will also play a key role in developing new features. Your focus will be on backend development, but there are possibilities to contribute to our frontend build in Vue and Streamlit as well.
You will take part in designing, implementing, and delivering our software. As we are a quite young and agile organization, on a very exciting growth journey, you will get a broad set of responsibilities. Thus, the desire to learn and ability to adapt and take in new information are your most important skills.

Your main tasks will include:
Developing new features for managing customer databases from a responsible gambling perspective
Working with complex and large time-series data and improving our data models.
Ensuring a high code quality and writing tests and documentation
Participating in and contributing to design ideas, innovation, code reviews and most importantly objective and constructive discussions.

Experience with the following is a requirement:
Python
Relational databases, data structures and data modelling
Software architecture
Git
Testing

Experience with the following is an advantage:
Microservices and Docker
Pytest, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy,
API development
Agile methods
Machine learning

Your profile
On the personal side, we imagine that you are self-motivating, ambitious, and like professional brainstorming with your colleagues as a means of decision making. You picture yourself in a small team with influence upon both assignments and technologies and enjoy high levels of both responsibilities and freedom. Good communication skills and fluency in English are required as we are an internationally minded company.
Professionally, we expect you to have at least a few years of experience with software engineering and development, as well as to be curious about the AI space. You have preferably worked with data-intensive systems before and enjoy a fast-paced development environment. Ideally, you have been a part of a team running a machine learning based service in production, but this is not a requirement.
We appreciate a sound theoretical foundation, but your educational background is not important to us; it is your personality, attitude, and skills that we prioritise. 

What we offer
A meaningful job with a high purpose; there are real people behind the data we collect, whose lives and their families’ lives can be improved from the insight we provide.
Influence, responsibility and partaking in a unique field where software, psychology and AI go hand in hand.
Competitive salary packaging based on your experience and qualifications, lunch, and an informal work environment with positive energy. A choice of equipment and a workspace with a great view of the Aarhus harbour on the fifth floor of the Navitas building. Remote work is also an option.
Mindway AI is operating as a separate company within the Better Collective Group (www.bettercollective.com), which is a Danish growth company, with HQ in Copenhagen, that has been listed at NASDAQ Stockholm stock exchange (Share code: BETCO) since 2018.

Should this job be yours?
If you are curious to hear more about the position or have any question, please do not hesitate to contact CEO Rasmus Kjaergaard on rk@mindway-ai.com or tel. +45 93 30 20 99. Please only send inquiries and no CVs to this email. 

We will look at the applications continuously and get back to you with an update on your application as soon as possible.

Camilla Svendsen 2nd
Managing Partner at Hudson Nordic
Send InMail
Har du lyst til at tage lead på data warehouse og Power BI i forhold til design, arkitektur og programmering samt lede et mindre team? Motiveres du af at være en aktiv driver i at gøre data tilgængelige og værdiskabende for en større del af forretningen? Og har du lyst til at indgå i et team af dygtige kollegaer med positiv teamånd, der sammen er på en ambitiøs digitaliseringsrejse med en ”Microsoft Cloud First” strategi hos Kemp & Lauritzen (K&L)? Så læs mere her…

Hudson Nordic søger en Lead BI & Data Developer med ansvar for at udvikle rammestrukturerne for data warehouse og Power BI. Du indgår i denne nyoprettede rolle i K&L’s Business Applications og vil sammen med resten af IT deltage i transformationen af IT-landskabet på tværs af hele organisationen. Du bliver en vigtig driver i at migrere data warehouse fra en on-prem-løsning til skyen og vil i den forbindelse kunne ”bygge” et data warehouse næsten fra bunden - og hvor du kan ”lege” med de arkitektoniske beslutninger, som du måske altid har ment er de rette.

Arbejdspladsen er på K&L’s hovedkontor på Roskildevej i Albertslund, og du refererer direkte til IT-direktøren og har ledelse af et par specialister, som primært arbejder med ”front-end” leverancerne i Power BI. Dertil bliver du en del af et stærkt og dynamisk team, der med høj faglighed og god energi sikrer at IT-landskabet i K&L glider effektivt for brugerne i forretningsområderne.

Ny stilling med fokus på rådgivning, design, arkitektur og programmering
I jobbet vil du arbejde med data warehouse og BI, og med andre ord vil du derved kunne bygge og styre arkitektoniske løsninger for datakilder og data, som dine kollegaer og forretningen skal bruge i udviklingen af værdiskabende rapporter og overblik. Du vil deltage i hele processen fra arkitektoniske overvejelser og valg, formulering af behov (i samarbejde med forretningen), design og programmering samt efterfølgende tests, support samt 2nd og 3rd level support.

Udover at være Subject Matter Expert omkring Power BI ift. den tekniske infrastruktur og at have en aktiv rolle i konkrete større projekter såsom migrering fra on-prem til skyen vil nogle af dine andre opgaver være:
·      Oversætte forretningsmæssige krav til tekniske løsninger, der leverer på forretningens forventning om indsigter i performance.
·      Opbygge, vedligeholde og udvikle data warehouse baseret på MS Azure services i samarbejde med Enterprise Arkitekt og Infrastruktur-teamet.
·      Designe ændringer, lave tekniske specifikationer samt planlægge og eksekvere tests.
·      Sikre korrekt anvendelse af data warehouses fysiske set-up (udvikle ETL processer).
·      Deltage i projekter såsom migreringen til Power BI og andre mindre projektopgaver.
·      Lede, udvikle og sikre tæt samarbejde med dine specialister i teamet.

Erfaren udvikler inden for Power BI og med lyst til at arbejde med bl.a. arkitektur
Først og fremmest søger vi ikke nødvendigvis dig, som er ekspert på alle områder. Vi leder efter dig med erfaring fra at bygge best practice BI-løsninger, helst på Microsoft Data Platformen, og gerne med en vis indsigt i andre BI-løsninger samt integration mellem BI og andre systemer. Med andre ord viser du en god bred forståelse for BI’s rolle i et IT-roadmap. Du har selvfølgelig erfaring med SQL.

IT-organisationen hos K&L har en meget stærk teamånd, hvor ingen er bange for at smøge ærmerne op for at hjælpe hinanden. Vi forestiller os derfor, at du har lysten til at samarbejde på tværs af IT-organisationen og forretningen for at finde de bedste løsninger. Du har måske ikke ledelseserfaring, men du er vant til at tage ansvar og lead på dine opgaver og har lyst til at udvikle dig som leder.

I dit arbejde er du systematisk og struktureret og har evnen til selvstændigt at prioritere dine opgaver. Qua dit specialistområde er du selvfølgelig analytisk og kan se strukturer i store datamængder og fra mange datakilder.

Om Kemp & Lauritzen
Kemp & Lauritzen leverer løsninger inden for el, VVS, ventilation og køl og tilbyder alt fra daglig service til store entrepriser og unikke specialer. Gennem årene har K&L stået for en række af Danmarks største teknikopgaver – fra servicering af Storebæltsforbindelsen til udvikling af driftskoncepter for flere af Danmarks store erhvervsvirksomheder. I alt har K&L 2.700 medarbejdere, hvoraf IT-organisationen består af ca. 27 medarbejdere samt adskillige eksterne konsulenter. IT-organisationen er en essentiel støtte i K&L’s generelle udvikling og vækst ved bl.a. at drive digitalisering og standardisering af systemer og værktøjer.

Lyder dette som noget for dig?

HR Business Partner hos cVation - Cloud Innovation 🚀☁️ We are hiring C# and Azure 🤗
Send InMail
Software Engineer og Azure udvikler

Har du evnen og interessen for at prøve kræfter med udvikling af komplekse Azure cloud-løsninger? cVation søger både erfarne og nyuddannede software udviklere til at indgå i vores voksende team, hvor høj faglighed, innovation og udviklerglæde er i højsæde.

cVation er et dansk udviklingshus, som bygger avancerede Azure cloud-løsninger hos vores kunder med afsæt i markedets hurtigste og mest agile metoder. Vi er på forkant med teknologierne og arbejder med mange af de nye teknologier, herunder AI, ML, IoT og Blockchain.

Hvilken rolle får du?
Du vil blive en del af et team, der designer og udvikler avancerede cloud-løsninger på MS Azure og er dedikerede til agile arbejdsmetoder, DevOps og Test Driven Development. Vi har en meget høj release frekvens i vores projekter, og som nyansat kan du forvente at se din egen kode i produktion allerede den første uge du er ansat. Uanset om du er nyuddannet eller har flere år på bagen. Vi har udviklet en værktøjskasse, der resulterer i ekstremt agile IT-projekter, og vores udviklingsteam releaser kode i et højdynamisk flow.

Udviklerne i cVation er samlet i små teams på 5-8 udviklere. Alle vores udviklere sidder i København – vi outsourcer eller nearshorer ikke. Derudover har vi også etableret et CCoE (Cloud Center of Excellence), som løbende vurderer nye cloud services og opdaterer værktøjskassen med relevante opdateringer. CCoE arbejder tæt sammen med de enkelte udviklingsteams, som har fingeren på pulsen ude på kundeprojekterne.
Ud over de hyppige releases til produktion har vi en ekstrem høj grad af automatisering af alt fra unit tests til integrationstests, UI-tests og performancetests. Det betyder, at de repetitive processer er fjernet, så der er luft til at tænke innovativt, hvilket kommer vores kunder til gode i form af hurtigere løsninger med højere kvalitet og en større forretningsmæssig værdi – og du får mulighed for faglig fordybelse, og at udvikle dig indenfor de nyeste teknologier. 

Hvad forventer vi af dig?
Erfaring med cloud-udvikling og særligt PaaS services fra MS Azure, vil klart være en fordel. Men ellers skal du nok få det lært.

Nyuddannet:
Kandidat i softwareudvikling
Erfaring med C# eller lignende objektorienteret sprog
Du vil gerne indgå i et agilt setup, hvor krav og retning hurtigt kan ændres, men hvor medbestemmelse og frihed er i højsædet
Det er en fordel, hvis du har arbejdet med Git, Automatiseret test og Automatiseret build og release

Kandidater med mere erfaring:
Kandidat i softwareudvikling
Vi forventer, at du er erfaren i C#, og at du går op i kodekvalitet og skrive testbar kode
Du har flere års erfaring med softwareudvikling og gerne webudvikling
Du vil gerne indgå i et agilt setup, hvor krav og retning hurtigt kan ændres, men hvor medbestemmelse og frihed er i højsædet
Du har arbejdet med automatisering af test, build og release pipelines
Er vant til at arbejde med versionskontrol, gerne Git
Du vil gerne arbejde med de nyeste teknologier i Azure og .NET Core

Du taler og skriver flydende dansk, og taler og skriver engelsk på et medium/højt niveau.

Som person er du ansvarsbevidst, initiativrig, eksekverende og resultatorienteret. Du gør dig umage med dine opgaver, trives med at løfte i flok og være en del af et team. Hvis du også er engageret og nysgerrig, drevet af at lære nyt og sætter en ære i konstant at dygtiggøre dig og forbedre både kode, værktøjer samt processer, vil du passe perfekt ind hos cVation.

Hvad tilbyder vi?

Vi ansætter de bedste
Du kommer til at indgå i vores voksende team, hvor høj faglighed, innovation og arbejdsglæde er i højsæde. Det høje faglige niveau blandt dine kollegaer giver dig en unik mulighed for at arbejde med de bedste, og vi tager din faglige videreudvikling alvorligt. Du vil således løbende indgå i eller arbejde tæt sammen med vores Cloud Center of Excellence, så vi sikrer, at alle er med på den seneste udvikling.

Vi har en flad organisation med et minimum af administration, hvor ledelsens døre altid er åbne, og der er god plads til både bordfodbold, fredagsbar, frokost på kajen og et aktivt liv udenfor arbejdstid. Flere gange om året afholder vi hackathons, hvor vi i teams dykker ned i præcis de emner, som udviklerne finder interessante. Og vi opfordrer alle udviklere til at udfordre og komme med input til, hvordan vi kan optimere, forbedre og udvikle os.

Hvorfor Os?

Fordi der er ikke noget sted som cVation!
Vi arbejder 100% med Microsoft udvikling, Azure og cloud. Vi taler ikke bare om, at vi skal i skyen, vi er allerede i skyen og har bygget cloud-løsninger i en årrække. Vi skaber for alvor værdi for kunden, når standardløsningerne ikke længere rækker. Vi løser komplekse udfordringer i kritiske industrier (bl.a. luftfart og finanssektoren) og bygger fra bunden. Vi er passionerede omkring at nytænke og omdanne kundernes strategi til konkret afkast. Vi har fokus på innovation for at skabe løsninger, der er hurtigere, enklere og meget mere intelligente.

Du vil få kollegaer, der er interesseret i at lære og har ønske om at blive de bedste til det, de gør. Vi tilbyder derfor gode muligheder for at udvikle dig og naturligvis gode benefits.

Du vil blive en del af en virksomhed, som tror på, at alle har betydning, og at det skal være sjovt at gå på arbejde hver dag.

Interesseret?

Recruitment Specialist at Lunar 💥🚀
Send InMail
Do you want to be part of building the foundation for one of our new squads, Rosetta? Can you see yourself working to help our banking and financial operations team execute and maintain the ever-growing amount of economic data flowing through our bank? Rosetta needs to operate in our banking systems’ deepest cores and foundations and extract information from a spectrum of external systems. 

Are you up for the challenge? Send us your application now. 💪

A look under the hood - our tech
We have built our internal technology platform on an event-based microservice architecture and have about 250 of them running. Continuous and independent deployability is crucial, as we release about 1000 times to production a month. We aim to be multi-cloud, but with most of our services running in Kubernetes on AWS. We love GoLang but honestly believe in using the right tool for the job: Python, JavaScript, or whatever else gets the job done.

At Lunar, we build the rocket ship while we race to the moon and beyond. To do that, we simultaneously are expanding our offerings and features while we maintain a solid, optimised and scalable platform for our more than 250.000 customers. It requires steady nerves and a super steady focus doing that.

Your elevator-pitch
Rosetta is all about data, and you love that. You don't necessarily get your highs from building next level predictive models, but more from enabling a rock-solid data foundation of financial and customer data. You know and appreciate the importance of having impeccable quality data, and your friends are sick and tired of you using the phrase ""Garbage in, Garbage out"" all the time. 

You want to work in an environment where you and your squad are the ones that set the limits, and you want to aim for the moon. You are open-minded and a team player at your very core. So you, of course, want to be part of a diverse team that consists of the right people from all over the business handpicked to complete the mission. 

You have experience working with data, and you have a good idea of how to get your hands on it, align it and expose it to both internal and external consumers.
Finally, you dig financial data and understand the basic needs of balancing and possibly report on it.

The role & tasks
At Lunar, we work in squads, each on a specific mission. A squad consists of cross-disciplinary members that make up all the skills needed to complete the mission, that being developers, line-of-business, QA or plain old subject matter experts. You will be part of squad Rosetta and work out of our Tech-hub in Copenhagen, the newest spawn in our tech community. Tech-hub CPH is so fresh that we expect you to be part of forming a unique style and culture and assist it in growing the hub. 

As a Data Engineer in Rosetta, your primary task will be to ensure the collection, validation, refinement and exposure of data for our core banking operations and our financial team. The job includes tasks like :
Collect, and validate event data from relevant internal services.
Build integrations with external data sources for ingestion and transformation.
Ensure quantitative and qualitative validation of data.
Transform and expose data to consumers that being as flat files, databases or API's

The Tech
Rosetta's tech stack focuses on the possibility of working with, getting and making data available to data consumers. To ensure this, Rosetta is the primary consumers, builders and maintainers of the financial data platform 'Enterprise'. Enterprise is planned to be built on an Apache Airflow foundation. It uses S3 buckets and possible Redshift as data storage... unless you can bring forward the arguments for a better stack.

All about you
You have at least two years of experience working with data engineering, or the likes of it.
You either have an education in Computer Science, Engineering or Data Science, or experience from ""the School of Life"" that is equal.
Experience with some part of the tech stack is a must. That being Python programming, RabbitMQ, Data QA, ETL work, Cloud architecture, or other aspects that will ensure that we can complete the mission from a tech point of view.
You do not necessarily have any experience working with financial and banking data, but you have the discipline to ensure that the data is under the strictest governance.

What's in it for you?
You will have the unique opportunity to be part of building up not only the new bank of the Nordics but also the brand new Tech-hub from our excellent offices in central Copenhagen.
You will be part of a bunch of pretty intelligent techies and ambitious financial nerds from whom you will learn from and grow every day. 
You will be part of an informal organisation, where it is not the ironing of your shirt or your title that gives you the mandate to have an opinion but your arguments and passion for continually improving.
You will become part of a company that wants to make sure that you are well mentally and physically. This means that Yoga and meditation are encouraged throughout work hours, and if that is not your thing, we have padel tournaments, board games, cycling clubs and much more that you can take part in.

We love diversity and everything that makes us different from everybody else because that makes us extraordinary. We come from all kinds of backgrounds, and speak all kinds of languages, so English is our business language. Our most important value is respect and understanding because only with that mindset can we move forward with supersonic speed.

Are you ready to be part of the journey? 
If you want to be part of Lunar, a place where passion and opinions matter, and we strive for nothing less than awesomeness, then get in touch with us, and become part of Squad Rosetta.

If you have any questions regarding the position, please contact Bank Development Manager Anne Carøe Hald at ach@lunar.app or Head of Technology, Banking Operations, Anders Kring at akk@lunar.app, and they will try to answer your questions.

Er du motiveret for at sikre din egen faglige udvikling ved at arbejde med de nyeste teknologier på markedet og udviklede skræddersyede softwareløsninger for vores kunder? Og er du træt af legacy kode og har lyst til at få nye projekter mellem fingrene omgivet af dygtige kollegaer, som kan booste dig med masser af faglig sparring?

Så skal du slå til nu, for vi er på udkig efter nye kolleger i IT Minds, og vi er så klar til at bane vejen for din fremtidige karriere i vores softwarehus omgivet af nogle af Danmarks dygtigste udviklere i et stærkt fællesskab, hvor det er helt OK at tæve chefen i bordtennis og skåle weekenden ind med en fredagsøl.

Her er dit job fyldt med udfordringer og ansvar
Som Software Developer hos IT Minds kommer du ikke til at sidde i et hjørne og lave bugfixing eller drift af legacy systemer! Tværtimod, så har vi stor tiltro til dine evner, og vi arbejder ud fra principperne om tillid og fleksibilitet. Vi gør vores ypperste for at imødekomme lige netop dine ønsker til projekter og konkrete teknologier, som sikrer din udvikling rent fagligt. Og hvis du fx drømmer om en karriere som Senior Software Developer, hvor du er Tech Lead og hjælper med at estimere projekter og tage del i vores ansættelsesproces af nye tech-kolleger, så foreligger muligheden på den lidt længere bane.

Dine arbejdsdage kommer til at se ud, som følger:
Du arbejder med de nyeste teknologier og med varierende projekter, som matcher din egen motivation for faglig udvikling.
Du bliver tilknyttet et softwareteknologisk projekt, hvor du selvstændigt eller i samarbejde med dine kollegaer hjælper med at udvikle den rette teknologiske løsning til vores kunder - enten på et inhouse projekt eller sourcet ud som konsulent.
Du er i tæt dialog med kunden, og i kraft heraf er du selv med til at definere, hvilke teknologier og systemer der skal anvendes i projektet for at finde frem til den bedste løsning.
Du indhenter hjælp og sparring fra dine dygtige kolleger efter behov, og er du motiveret for teknisk opkvalificering, har du mulighed for at følge kurser via online video tutorials.
Du springer med på vores faglige workshops og morgenboosters og er nysgerrig og ivrig efter at lære nyt og lære fra dig.
Du tager del i fællesskabet, spiller et slag bordfodbold eller dribler rundt i FIFA på vores PS, mens du får et break til hovedet. Du spiser fredagsrundstykker med dine kollegaer og nupper en fredagsøl, melder dig ind i brætspilsklubben, brygger øl med IT-Pints, dyster i CS eller LOL på gamer nights og får en kaffesludder med dine coffeebuddies. Mulighederne er mange - og fair nok, hvis du mister pusten ved at deltage i det hele. Så joiner du bare det, du synes, er fedest. Eller opfinder dit eget Mindster-event.

Hvem er du?
Du er træt af Legacy kode og sulten efter at arbejde med de nyeste teknologier på skiftende projekter af høj kvalitet og med simpel kodestruktur.
Du er nyuddannet fra et af landets universiteter eller har et par års erfaring som Softwareingeniør, Datalog eller lignende.
Du har kendskab til .NET-platformen (C#), Java og/eller JavaScript, og du har erfaring med frameworks som eksempelvis ASP.NET, .NET core, Angular, React eller Vue.js samt SQL og NoSQL databaser, fx MongoDB.
Du har et hjerte, der banker for Frontend, Backend eller sågar Full Stack, og måske smånørder du med dine egne softwareprojekter i fritiden?


IT Minds er...
… et konsulenthus, der tilbyder skræddersyede, softwareteknologiske løsninger til vores kunder, som dækker alt fra mindre virksomheder til landets allerstørste.
Vi er en ung virksomhed med 180 medarbejdere i en god blanding af erfarne kræfter krydret med studerende og nyuddannede, der befinder sig i begyndelsen af deres karriere, og vi omgås alle hinanden i et miljø, der bærer præg af en høj grad af fleksibilitet, tillid og en særdeles uformel omgangstone.

Vores fællesskab er stærkt, og vi har både morgenboosters, brætspilsklub, ølbryggerklub, gamer- og pokeraftener, fredagsmorgenmad, onsdagskage, fredagsbarer og mere til. Og arbejdstiden er selvfølgelig fleksibel, så den kan gå op med både familieliv og fritid.
Som forretning har vi fokus på høj faglighed og kvalitet kombineret med de nyeste teknologier på markedet.

deltage i dialoger med teams og arkitekter for at få konkret viden fra dagligdagen ude i teams og binde det sammen med arkitekturstrategier til konkrete implementeringsplaner
udvikle mindre og større dataapplikationer i samspil med teams
lære vores MS SQL-server-implementering at kende inkl. miljøer, dataflows, udviklingsprocesser etc.
forberede og initiere de første elementer i grundlaget for DevOps på MS SQL-platformen, herunder facilitere videre proces i udviklingsteams.

”Du får en helt særlig mulighed for at være med til at påvirke hele vores virksomhed, arbejde med de nyeste teknologier og hurtigt få et meget bredt netværk. Samtidig er vi et team med en uformel omgangstone og en stærk agil ledelse,” siger afdelingsleder Anders Bak Jensen.

Gode udviklingsmuligheder i Bankdata
Alt afhængigt af dit udgangspunkt forestiller vi os, at du kan udvikle dig hen mod bl.a. en seniorstilling eller lead software developer. For den rigtige person med engagement, vilje og interesse kan der på sigt også være mulighed for at skifte til andet team og specialisere sig der.

Nysgerrig, motiverende og erfaren it-udvikler
Det er alfa og omega, at du er nysgerrig på nye teknologier og måder at gøre tingene på – du skal turde at udfordre status quo, uden at vi nødvendigvis har brug for en reel rebel. Samtidig kan du holde fokus på en stabil drift og løbende forbedringer samt de eksisterende systemer. Slutteligt er du god til at kommunikere og samarbejde med en række forskellige mennesker, da dit arbejde i høj grad foregår på tværs af teams.

Vi forestiller os desuden, at du:
er it-uddannet – det kan både være en lang og en kort uddannelse
har erfaringer med MS SQL-platformen, enten fra udviklersiden eller fra server-/infrastruktursiden – allerhelst en kombination af de to
har arbejdet med datamodellering, DevOps, Microsoft Cloud Azure og gerne samspillet mellem MS SQL server og Azure.

Velkommen til et yngre team med en stærk faglighed og højt humør
Team Platform er et relativt nyt og ungt team, der med dig er fuldtalligt og lander på 5 medlemmer og en product owner. Vi har store teknologiske ambitioner på vores rejse fra COBOL og host til cloud/MS SQL, og teamet spiller en stor rolle i at facilitere og motivere denne rejse på tværs af afdelinger i samspil med afdelingslederne og andre ildsjæle.

Interesseret?
Har du spørgsmål til jobbet, er du velkommen til at kontakte ansættende afdelingsleder Anders Bak Jensen på: 5136 0091 eller ajn@bankdata.dk. Vi inviterer løbende kandidater til samtale, så søg allerede i dag.

Vi glæder os til at høre fra dig!
Bankdata er ejet af 8 pengeinstitutter og er med sine godt 800 ansatte en af landets største IT-arbejdspladser. Vi tilbyder stor frihed i jobbet, personlige udviklingsmuligheder, en række personalemæssige goder og en løn, der matcher jobbet. Analyser viser, at vi har nogle af landets mest tilfredse medarbejdere, og du kan læse meget mere om, hvad nogle af dem siger om at arbejde hos Bankdata.

Send InMail
Ambitiøs Senior IT & Business Analyst søges til BI & Analytics Gazelle-virksomhed 

Kan du noget helt særligt inden for BI og datavisualisering? Har du erfaring med Microsoft Power BI, DAX, Power Platformen, Azure og SQL – og kunne du tænke dig arbejde med nogle af Danmarks største virksomheder? Så er det dig, vi søger!  

VENZO Analytics søger ambitiøse Senior IT & Business Analysts til en hurtigt voksende BI og Analytics virksomhed. Vi har kontor i København NV og Aarhus og arbejder med:  

Analytics og visualisering i Microsoft Power BI og Power Platformen 
Data warehouse modernisering og migrering til Azure  
BI migrering fra særligt Tableau, Qlick og TARGIT til Microsoft Power BI   
IT Service Management (ITSM) og Financial Analytics   
Demokratisering af data og BI self-service. 

Hertil har vi udviklet et koncept, der integrerer datavidenskab og psykologi ved datavisualisering med henblik på at styrke ledelsens evne til at træffe beslutninger og skabe forandringer i deres organisation. 

Om dig og dine kvalifikationer  
Du er motiveret af at visualisere data i æstetisk smukke dashboards, som er enkle (less is more), og som understøtter ledelsens behov for et hurtigt og effektivt overblik. Vi måler vores succes med dashboards/datavisualisering ved, at de bliver aktivt anvendt af kunderne – og skaber et reelt grundlag for beslutning og ændret adfærd. Derfor er det afgørende, at du kan identificere og forstå kundens behov for ”data storytelling” – dvs. sætte dig ind i de svar, som datavisualiseringen skal give og den ændrede adfærd, som det skal skabe for kunden.  

Vi arbejder efter et princip, vi kalder ”10-60-600”. Det betyder, at et dashboard skal skabe overblik indenfor 10 sekunder, identificere afvigelser og handlemuligheder inden for 60 sekunder, og give mulighed for at ”drille ned” og udforske rådata og årsagsforklaringer indenfor 600 sekunder. Alt sammen med udgangspunkt i kunden behov og forretning. Du er motiveret for at forstå kundens behov og visualisere data, så de understøtter ”10-60-600” designprincippet og styrker kundens evne og mulighed for at træffe beslutninger og skabe ændret adfærd.  

Du har erfaring med Microsoft Power, DAX, SQL – og forstår at bruge kildedata til at designe data warehouses (DWH fact dimensioner etc.). Du er Microsoft certificeret i en eller flere decilpiner.   

Det er en fordel, hvis du har erfaring med migrering fra Qlick, Tableau eller TARGIT til Microsoft Power BI. Det er yderligere en fordel, hvis du har erfaring med at etablere skalérbar cloud infrastruktur til SaaS services.

Din tilgang til problemløsning er pragmatisk og agil, og du er vant til skabe bro mellem forretning og rå datasæt. Du søger konstant at forenkle og simplificere og forstår vigtigheden af kundens deltagelse i den proces.   

Du har bopæl i Danmark og kan fremvise en ren straffeattest.  

Vi tilbyder en anderledes BI og Analytics arbejdsplads 

VENZO Analytics er en ambitiøs virksomhed med drevne ambitiøse medarbejdere og plads til personlig og faglig udvikling. Vi har det princip, at ”din markedsværdi skal stige gennem dit arbejde, mens du fastholdes gennem trivsel og godt kollegaskab”. Derfor søger vi konstant udfordringer og uddannelse/certificeringer, som gør os selv og hinanden dygtigere. Vi måler os selv i kundernes positive tilbagemeldinger – og sætter en ære i, at vores løsninger gør en markant og mærkbar forskel for kunderne. Denne forskel kan være gennem reducerede omkostninger til cloud infrastruktur eller ved at skabe dashboards, som bliver anvendt til at tage beslutninger samt skabe ændret adfærd hos kunderne.

Vi søger de absolut bedste – og de bedste i vores perspektiv er dygtige og ambitiøse kollegaer, som forstår at støtte og hjælpe hinanden til at lykkes i fællesskab. Vi er et hold, og vi passer på hinanden. 

Vores omgivelser er uprætentiøse og afslappede. Påklædning varierer fra vandkæmmet hår og jakkesæt til T-shirts og kondisko. Det afgørende er ambitioner, kvalifikationer og evnen til at samarbejde og lykkes i fællesskab. Vi er meget forskellige, men forenet i at lykkes som et hold. 

Om stillingen som Senior IT & Business Analyst og ”Trusted advisor” 

Som Senior IT & Business Analyst vil du indgå som en vital del af vores Analytics team samt indgå aktivt i at understøtte leverancer på én eller flere forskellige kundeprojekter. Du vil indgå i et tæt samarbejde med forretningsressourcer både internt i VENZO og hos kunder.  

Projekterne er forskellige og kan variere lige fra migrering og visualisering af et Excel-regneark til etablering af en global rapporteringsplatform. Hertil kommer migrering fra Qlick, Tableu og TARGIT til Microsoft Power BI. Den røde tråd er data warehouse modernisering, BI demokratisering/self-service og datavisualisering (som bygger på VENZOS 10-60-600 princip). Din rolle og fokus vil afhænge af din erfaring, kompetencer og interesser. I det omfang du motiveres af salg, vil du medvirke til pre-sales og tilbudsskrivning.  

Vi arbejder typisk i teams bestående af en projektleder, Power BI specialist (datavisualisering) og backend specialist (data warehouse, Azure, SQL, SSAS). Ved større projekter bemandes med flere kollegaer, og opgaver/projekter løses selvstændigt/alene eller i mindre grupper. Uanset projektets størrelse, er samarbejde og adgang til kollegaernes input og sparring en afgørende faktor.    

Du vil desuden indgå i rådgivning og vejledning af kunder – og medvirke til at udarbejde BI strategier og beslutningsoplæg til kundernes valg af fremtidig dataplatform. Du forstår således betydningen af rollen som ”Trusted Advisor” og evner at sætte dig ind i kundens behov og forretning, så du kan vejlede og rådgive optimalt.   

Case og præsentation for ledelsen  

I forbindelsen med rekrutteringsprocessen, vil du blive bedt om at løse en case. Casen omfatter et dataudtræk og en række spørgsmål, som skal løses i Power BI og præsenteres for ledelsen i VENZO Analytics.  

Om VENZO 

Som ansat i VENZO kan du se frem til et selvstændigt job med bred kontakt til såvel kunder som hele VENZO’s organisation. Kulturen er dynamisk med en uformel og direkte omgangstone – og du vil i høj grad få mulighed for at sætte dit eget præg på stillingen. Derudover lægger vi stor vægt på, at du løbende udvikler og styrker dine kompetencer, da det er afgørende for VENZO at fastholde et højt fagligt niveau blandt vores medarbejdere. Lønnen afspejler dine kompetencer.  
Hvis du mener, det er dig, vi leder efter, og at du har det der skal til for at blive en del VENZO, så kontakt os nu. Send din ansøgning og CV til os på e-mail hr@venzo.com att.: Mads Liebst – og har du spørgsmål, er du velkommen til at kontakte Director, Mads Liebst på tlf. +45 2578 4028 eller Partner, Søren Anderberg på telefon +45 2029 4673.

148,Business Analyst,VELUX,"Skjern, Middle Jutland, Denmark",1 alum works here,"At the VELUX Group, we give you the chance to grow. To shape your own career. To work in an international environment. To be part of a company that leads the market in sustainable indoor living. We offer you a world of opportunities – if you have the ability and the drive to take them.

Would you like to take up a proactive role where you get to bring your own ideas to the table as you collaborate directly with the colleagues that receive the insights you generate? A role where your reports are the foundation of how we make decisions across the VELUX Group?

Then join us to utilise a wide range of quality data from our supply chain and customer service to elevate our quality performance.

Your challenges

Joining 3 dedicated business analyst colleagues, you will step into our Performance and System Management team in either Østbirk or Skjern. As part of our global quality organisation, we have ownership of our Factory registration systems (Q-DAS and SAP QM) used by our quality inspectors and machine operators across our global production companies and, even more importantly, translating data into valuable insights for the VELUX business.

You will team up with experienced colleague, located in Østbirk or Skjern, to provide our supply organisation and other stakeholders with the reports they need to make data-based decisions. Thus, you will :

Be responsible for development of our Registration System on the factories, including govern the use of the systems.
Proactively interact with quality assurance colleagues to identify their information needs.
Investigate the possibilities for use of Machine Learning based on production data.
Build unique reports and maintain and adjust standard reports in Power BI and SAP Analytics Cloud.

”You’ll function just as much as a consultant as an analyst in this role. If a colleague asks for a specific report, you help identify what opportunities we have to shed light on the subject and come up with your own ideas to make it as useful as possible,” explains Jakob Blichert-Toft, Manager of PSM.

Your Qualifications

It is important that you are just as fond of collaborating with colleagues and creating value for the business as you are of crushing data. We imagine that :

You have experience as a business analyst or that you have obtained a business degree related to BI.
You have a proactive approach to your work and show initiative.
You are a fast learner and a strong collaborator.
You preferably have experience in Power BI and/or SAP Analytics Cloud and/or SAP QM – but it is not a prerequisite.
Your opportunities

You will join a highly self-driven team of colleagues that are good at taking initiative and sharing knowledge. Even though we work from different locations, we meet up on the phone every single morning to discuss tasks and share experiences. This way, you will quickly get a hold of things and feel as part of the team.

Linking production and customer service from a global point of view, you will get a broad interface and interact with colleagues from across the world. Thus, you will establish a great professional network and learn from highly competent colleagues in both your immediate team and within the VELUX organisation.

You will gain hands-on experience with top-of-class data processing in a global company which will give you a solid foundation for your future career as a data specialist.

“This role will give you unique insights into the quality set-up of a global supply chain and customer service organisation, and your analyses will make a huge difference for our decision makers,” finishes Jakob.

Application and contact

If you would like to know more about this opportunity and the VELUX Group, please feel free to contact Jakob Blichert-Toft by telephone +45 7669 3460.

We look forward to receiving your application and CV as soon as possible. We are screening and interviewing on an ongoing basis, so don’t wait to apply!

158,"Data Engineer, Marketing Tech",Wolt,"Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark",2 company alumni work here,"We are looking for not one, but hopefully two or even three Data Engineers to join our shiny, new Marketing Tech team! This is a great opportunity if you like to work with heavy volumes of near-real-time data, modern technologies, and in a team that has a significant impact on the business! 

This team was put together to take our marketing efficiency to the next level. We already have a team lead and there are many projects bubbling under, waiting for the right people to come along. Maybe you? The team aims to provide data-centric solutions and services that empower stakeholders with things such as automated advertisement buying, real-time data, content generation, workflow automation, marketing insights, and more. The team works at the intersection of backend- and data engineering.

We are a heavily data-run company and in this team, you will be working with a mix of 3rd party and internal data in large volumes. On a daily basis, you could be working with data modeling, streaming data, backend development, automating manual workflows, and integrating our team’s tech with other services at Wolt.

The team is based in Helsinki HQ but welcomes a new member to the Helsinki HQ or working entirely remotely elsewhere in Finland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden or Estonia now and in the future! 

Our humble expectations

In this team attitude and desire to get things done comes first. Our data platform is mainly built with Python and the team operates services written in Go, but we value experience in other backend technologies as well. You will be able to influence the technologies that we will be taking on in the future and inside Wolt e.g. Scala and Kotlin are popular. You know what it takes to build scalable software services in production and probably know your way around data modeling and databases. We use Postgres, MongoDB, and Snowflake for warehousing. We also work with Kafka, but don’t let it stop you if you haven’t worked with that before.

Good communication and collaboration skills and taking ownership will take you far and in this team there will be room for you to grow and take responsibility. If your background has been more backend heavy but you’ve been looking to dive also into data engineering, this could be the right fit for you!  

Next Steps

The positions will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so please apply quickly! The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and Wolt stock options. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you'll own a piece of the pie.

If you want to check up on your application or have any further questions about the position, you can turn to Talent Acquisition Partner Jasmin Shams, jasmin.shams@wolt.com at any given time.

About Wolt
Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt works together with over 30,000 restaurant and retail partners as well as with over 60,000 courier partners across 23 countries and 129 cities.

Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest reviews, largely because of our customer-centric approach to how we build our products and operations. For example, our customer service team responds in a matter of seconds, in the customer’s own language.
We’ve raised more than €707M in financing from renowned U.S. and European based investors, such as ICONIQ Capital, Tiger Global, DST, Prosus, KKR, Coatue, 83North, Goldman Sachs, Highland Europe and EQT Ventures & EQT Growth, among others. We've also been fortunate enough to receive some appreciation and recognition for our hard work along the way: Apple selected Wolt’s app as their Editors' Choice, Wired named the company one of the ""Hottest Startups in Europe,"" Forbes included our CEO Miki Kuusi on its 30-under-30 in Consumer Tech list, and the Nordic Startup Awards named Wolt Company of the Year.

In 2020, the Financial Times named us Europe’s second fastest growing company. We’re still expanding rapidly and are looking for more talented individuals to join us. If you are passionate about cutting-edge technology, great food, and making an impact in your city, then Wolt just might be for you.

Wolt is more than just a food and retail delivery operation – in fact we are built upon a solid foundation of state-of-the-art technology. Our internal tooling enables us to ramp up new cities efficiently and provide excellent customer service, our own logistics platform allows us to optimise our couriers' work to get you the food you want as fast as possible, and our restaurant platform allows restaurants to offer exciting food experiences for our customers in an optimal way.

We work in small teams with high ownership, with each team focusing on a key area of the Wolt product stack. Each and every one of our product team members has a say in where we are going and what solutions we implement. We work with a passion, but we haven't forgotten how to have fun along the way!

180,Data Engineer (Hadoop/Spark),"LiveIntent, Inc.","Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark",Actively recruiting,"To our highly-skilled development team in Copenhagen we seek a Data Engineer (Hadoop/Spark) for our Data Pipeline team. LiveIntent Copenhagen stands for the development and deployment of the company's next generation technology in close collaboration with the company's other departments in New York, Berlin and Moscow.

Our team in Copenhagen consists of a few veterans from the start-up environment and 20 new hand-picked colleagues. Both the level of competence and focus is very high. For that reason, many exciting tasks are constantly flowing from the rest of the organization to Copenhagen, so we want to expand the team with more skilled and innovative talents. 

The Position
As our new Data Engineer (Hadoop/Spark), you will lead our Data Pipeline team and be part of improving our technologies for distributed batch processing. The Data Pipeline teams dream is to provide an environment where it is extremely easy to deploy a hadoop or spark job that processes terabytes of data such that we can improve the daily life of our colleagues that use the platform. This involves solving hard problems like:

Automatic configuration of spark jobs based on previous runs
Detection of skewness in data
Scheduling of processing jobs on correct instance types
Automatic restarting of jobs that failed due to instabilities in underlying infrastructure

The Data Pipeline team is responsible for maintaining and improving our batch processing infrastructure. On a daily basis we run a pipeline consisting of Spark and Hadoop jobs as well as ad hoc jobs. We have chosen to create a customized platform based on open source hadoop/spark distributions instead of going with a prepackaged solution like AWS EMR

Your daily work life will include but will not be limited to the following tasks:
Maintain a vision for the pipeline team and future direction
Lead the pipeline team and mentor members of the team
Interact with other team leads and coordinate work
Plan work and features for the pipeline infrastructure
identify, design and implement internal process improvement:
automating manual processes
optimizing job run time and costs
build analytics tools to provide actionable insights:
ease troubleshooting
job optimization
reporting
work with other teams inside the Engineering department to debug potential job issues, such as data skewness, load imbalance, poor performance and other difficult to debug issues. 

We believe in flexibility under responsibility, and our development process is therefore a loosely defined hybrid of agile methods and rapid prototyping.

Your Profile
You are having a great time diving into hadoop S3 committers and understand why files are missing.
Solving problems for others and see your team members develop is enjoyable
Solid understanding of fundamental Computer Science concepts, e.g., operating systems, network fundamentals. Knowledge and/or experience with distributed systems is a plus
Experience with data analysis and/or data processing. Experience with big data is a plus
Eager to understand and find solutions in the problem areas
Good interpersonal skills and ability to work well with all levels of colleagues, e.g., listening and communicating clearly, sharing knowledge and learning from others
Experience with Hadoop/Spark is highly desired
Experience with one or more of the following is a plus:
Linux
Cloud services, e.g. AWS
Scala/Python
Docker/Kubernetes

You are full of good ideas, able to see opportunities and weaknesses in other people's ideas, and can come up with your own ideas in a constructive way. You are happy to implement and optimize and you are curious about new tasks.

You are in a dynamic environment where overall priorities and definitions will change over time, and therefore tasks will not always be prioritized. You can hand over tasks, but prefer to follow them to the door itself. You work independently and in the initiative.

We Offer
You can look forward to being a key player in a challenging and dynamic developmental story where you will be part of a team with some of the industry's hottest talents. There will be rich opportunities to learn from others, and you will have the flexibility to dive into experiments on your own. We are passionate about new solutions, technologies and algorithms, but pragmatic in our choice of solutions.

We believe in freedom and flexibility under responsibility so that office hours can be adapted to your life as long as meetings are covered. If you need to work from home one day, it is completely fine, as long as you live up to what is expected.We are an international company, with frequent contact between the departments in Berlin and New York City. The position is located in our office in Copenhagen.
 The Company

Tag næste skridt i din karriere som softwareudvikler?

Atkins udviklerteam består af IT-arkitekter, JAVA- og .Net-udviklere, projektledere, rådgivere og web-designere, som arbejder tæt sammen om at udvikle web-baserede løsninger af høj kvalitet. Typisk arbejder vi i mindre projektteams med udgangspunkt i en række forskellige spændende teknologier, og vi sammensætter den løsningsarkitektur, som vi vurderer, bedst opfylder det enkelte projekts behov. Vi lægger stor vægt på at være på forkant med udviklingen og tager gerne nye teknologier i brug.

Som en del af udviklerteamet vil du være med til at skabe løsninger, som ofte vil blive anvendt af mange brugere, og hvor der er høje krav til ydeevne, stabilitet og brugervenlighed. Vi har erfaring med, hvad der skal til for at opnå dette, og vi vil supplere den viden, du allerede har med vores praktiske erfaring.

Du har stor interesse for programmering og gerne i alle lag (full-stack). Du har naturlige evner for programmering og kan lide at sætte dig ind i nye teknologier. Desuden er du ansvars- og kvalitetsbevidst og trives i et arbejdsmiljø, hvor vi hjælper og lærer af hinanden.

Hvis du erfaring med nedenstående eller lignende teknologier, vil vi gerne høre fra dig:

Relationel database i PostgreSQL
Drift under brug af Cloud og Cloud API’er i Amazon Cloud tjenester (AWS), MS Azure

OpenLayers
GeoServer

192,Passioneret softwareudvikler og god holdspiller søges,IDA,"København, Capital Region, Denmark",Actively recruiting,"Hvem er vi?

Vi er en divers flok af 9 kolleger som udgør Team Spirit, hvis primære ansvarsområde er IDAs medlems- og arrangementssystemer. IDA er en af Danmarks største udbydere af kurser og arrangementer. Årligt afvikler vores aktive over 3000 arrangementer, samt et utal af kurser og konferencer, så der sker masser af spændende udvikling både i form af arbejde med hjemmesider, api’er og backend services som understøtter disse aktiviteter.

Vi har også ansvaret for IDAs designsystem, et komponent-bibliotek, der indeholder de generelle react-komponenter, som bruges på tværs af vores web-løsninger. Til sidst arbejder vi også med udvikling og vedligeholdelse af IDAs kundedatabase.

Vi tror på den agile tilgang i vores daglige udvikling, fordi vi har set værdien i at have en kort vej til produktion, levere løbende værdi i korte iterative udviklingsforløb og lave løbende justeringer baseret på feedback og erfaringer. Som en del af Team Spirit arbejder du tæt sammen med dine kolleger i teamet, vi er hinandens sparringspartnere og løser opgaver i fællesskab. Vi hjælper hinanden med at komme i mål sammen, og derfor bliver det at uddybe opgavebeskrivelser, tegne mockups, pair programme, videndele og code reviewe en naturlig del af din dagligdag som udvikler.

Vi bygger også vores IT-landskab med agilitet for øje, hvilket betyder at der udvikles efter en mikroserviceorienteret arkitektur, og vi kører en overordnet strategi om at rykke vores on-premise løsninger i skyen. Til at understøtte denne udvikling har vi bygget en applikationsplatform på Microsofts Azure-platform, og vi har givet de agile teams stort medejerskab i både fundament, pipelines og processer omkring udviklingen.

Den ideelle kandidat…

Besidder eller kan tillære sig et sæt af færdigheder, som tilsammen udgør en god udvikler og en god holdspiller. Du er med andre ord…
En backend-udvikler. Du har kendskab til .net core og .net framework og kan lide at arbejde med microservices, api’er og centrale systemer. Du er desuden opsøgende og nysgerrig i din opgave- og problemløsning og elsker at dykke ned i komplekse problemstillinger.
Fagligt stærk i softwarearkitektur og designprincipper. Du har brugt arkitektur-, organiserings- og designprincipper aktivt i din udvikling, samt forstår fordelene og ulemperne ved brugen af dem. Du følger med i nye tendenser indenfor softwareudvikling og kan forholde dig kritisk til dem.
En kvalitetsbevidst udvikler. Du leverer kode af en kvalitet, som du kan stå inde for, og har erfaring med automatisering af tests og arbejdsgange, som bliver repetitive. Med andre ord: Du er doven, men på den gode måde!
En udvikler-generalist. Du vil gerne favne mange discipliner indenfor softwareudvikling og tager gerne opgaver som falder lidt udenfor dit ekspertiseområde.
En god holdspiller. Du får energi af at samarbejde tæt med dine kolleger og opsøger aktivt at bidrage til ting som; dialog med kunderne, design og udformning af ideer, sparring og inddragelse af kolleger.
Det får du i IDA

Som udvikler i IDA arbejder du fri af tid og sted, og vi har lukrative forhold for ferie og fritimer. Arbejdstiden er 37 timer, og vi arbejder ikke med interessetimer. Vores ansatte brænder for at skabe værdi for brugerne på tværs af afdelinger, men de kan stadig nå hjem og hente ungerne eller komme med til fredagsbaren i naboafdelingen.

Vi er som alle andre arbejdspladser ramt af corona-hjemsendelser, men tilbyder en infrastruktur, der sikrer at den digitale udvikling kører fint hjemmefra. Men du kan glæde dig til sammen med os, at mødes igen til den smukke udsigt over Københavns havn og kantinen, der leverer lækker frokost hver dag.

Vi værdsætter ansvar og integritet

Vi har frie og uformelle rammer, og du får indflydelse på alle processerne i arbejdet fra planlægning til release. Vi tror på tillid, transparens og fælles ansvarlighed - både internt i teamet og i samarbejdet med afdelingen og resten af huset. Du får rig mulighed for at få indflydelse på dine opgaver og udarbejdelsen af vores platforme. Det er sammen, at vi skaber resultater og udvikler de bedste produkter. Vi sparrer med hinanden og arbejder på vores opgaver med integritet og en dyb forståelse for samspillet mellem brugere, systemer og løsninger.

198,Software Engineer - Backend,Pleo,"Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark",1 alum works here,"Oh great. Another tech startup is looking for another backend engineer. But is this job post even worth a read-through?

I'd say so. We're not going to tell you all about the company in because that's not who we are, that's why we're working together. Instead, let me start off by telling you about the types of people we are, and the type of person you'd need to be to fit right into our working style and attitude.

In our engineering team, we geek out over great craftsmanship: you'll find our Slack channels littered with latest news articles on backend trends and new resources to test out there. We share upcoming conferences, and then we team up and go to them. We learn a language and then we teach each other. We're always trying to get better at what we do, and so our product is the playground for this. We're always willing and interested in keeping our stack up to date, and to trying out new ways of working.

The other thing is that we love to hire people who bring a different perspective. We're a Nordic company which means we live out a flat hierarchy. This means that we'll listen to an intern's voice as much as an engineering lead's. The most important thing here is that we check our egos at the door, and make sure that work is a happy environment in which to learn. We listen to one another, and we adapt continuously. We're looking for someone who is excited by this - we'd love to have you making your mark on how we build the backend of Pleo. Saying that, we're all pretty opinionated, so you'll have a lot of people to rubber duck with! 🦆

We're also not the type of people who will look down on someone because they ask a fairly straight-forward question. (Ask our poor head of people who writes our product job posts with us!) Because of this we need someone to join us who shares this mindset, and isn't looking to be The Next Ultimate Brogrammer out there.

You'll notice a red thread through this job post: we're not looking for ""X amount of years of experience"" or adding flashy titles to this job post. You could be a recent graduate with amazing potential, or instead you could be a seasoned backender who just loves what you do. We don't care: we have a mixture of great people with different levels. Our team is getting to the size where we can support both career paths. There are opportunities to manage teams coming up in the year, just as there are other opportunities to be mentored by existing (and future) team members. And if you just want to be the ultimate master of backend, there's room for experts too.

Quite a special part about Pleo is a lot of people in non-technical roles are actually learning code on the side. So if you're up for it a couple of our engineers work with them and give them some coaching on the work they've done (often in exchange for a home-cooked meal!). We've even seen someone go from Customer Success to becoming our Product Analyst which all started over a bowl of pasta and basic SQL cohorts.

So now you're getting an idea of who we are, let's talk about why we're doing it.

We believe in changing the future of work, and that's why our company expensing platform (Pleo) exists. We think that work will change to be more autonomous and flexible. Pleo is an app that delegates company spending to all employees with pre-paid cards: use your card (virtual/ physical), snap a pic of your receipt, and you're done. We take the pain away from employees having to pay out of pocket, and think that if you're going to trust an employee enough to hire them, you might as well trust them enough to spend company money sensibly.

If you say you're future of work, then you really need to live it out in your working culture. This is one of the reasons that our engineering team has been built with a remote-first mindset: we have engineers sitting between EST to CET, across the east coasts of the Americas, Africa, and Europe. As our backend engineer, you could either join us in Copenhagen if you'd like, or sit wherever you want if you fall between our timezones.

Here we work with people first, then coding comes into play.

Working as a backend engineer means you're all up with devops culture, observability and all its inner quirks of metrics, feature flags and testing in production. We try to innovate with modern infrastructure and technologies, but sometimes the good ol' boring stack also is great.

We are big fans of getting challenged, that involves pushing us around on distributed architecture, finding mitigation plans to working with strange partners like old banking technologies and finding new ways of reviewing code empathically.

You're going to work with designers, product managers, customer success people - and they're going to crave your solutions. You're not just a code monkey, although sometimes we need to code, you're also an architect of happiness and simplicity. We don't want to share a complicated product to our clients, and you will also have a big say in that.

If web services have no secrets for you, Kotlin, TypeScript, Kubernetes, Docker, AWS tickle your mind, come talk to us (applying is actually pretty easy - just share a profile link and write a hello message - no CV needed).

You know your way around
Server-side languages (we mostly use Kotlin and TypeScript but we know you can learn new languages)
Cloud environments (AWS, Azure, Heroku, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean)
...and micro-services / distributed systems (Kubernetes, AWS Lambda, Consul)
DevOps culture and tools (Travis, Gradle, Terraform)
Relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Spanner)
Basic scripting (Bash, Python)
Your colleagues say you
Work in English with ease (it's our company language)
Know that Go is more than a board game
Never stop being curious and love learning about new languages/ frameworks/ working styles
Are easy to work with
Would be a person that they would actually like to have a coffee with (virtual or not)
Your mom says that you
Love knowing how things work
Probably are an ace at board games
Take on challenges
Probably work in IT (moms)
Show Me The Benefits
Your own Pleo card (no more out-of-pocket spending)
Ability to work remotely (anywhere between east coast of the Americas to European timezones)......or onsite if you want to (Copenhagen, London, Berlin, Stockholm, Madrid)
Quarterly trips to somewhere for team camps (both company-wide ones and team-specific ones).
The last one was in Northern Ireland last December.
Investment in learning & developing (just check with your team for what's reasonable, we don't have set budgets)
And here are some other nice gestures that we do
Catered lunch in our HQ and London offices when you're here25 days holidays (annual)
Loads of weird and wonderful niche communities to join in the company (we're talking guerrilla gardening, liquids tasting, the Pleo band, learning to code initiatives, beer brewing, skiing, that type of thing)
Wild enthusiasm and encouragement from us if you want to host MeetUps, events, etc - we'll help (venue, food etc)
Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Through fintech we've seen a way to impact how people work; we think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. Based on some pretty amazing Series B-round investment in 2019, and a Series C-round announced in April 2021, we think we're onto something big.

So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 300+ team, from over 44 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, or Montreal offices – and quite a few full-time remotes in 15 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by sensible things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us we'll help you get up the best remote setup possible, and will fly you in once a quarter for team camps.

Vil du boltre dig med den nyeste teknologi i et agilt miljø? Og vil du være en del af et team, hvor vi hver dag gør hinanden klogere og ser softwareudvikling som en holdindsats?
”Vi har en stærk faglighed, både i afdelingen og på tværs af huset. Og fordi du bliver en af dem i teamet, der har det bedste kendskab til Java, microservice-arkitekturen og de nyeste udviklingsmetoder, kommer du til at få stor indflydelse,” forklarer afdelingsleder for Fonds Boye Nielsen.

Velkommen i et innovativt team med godt samarbejde
Du bliver det 8. medlem af Team Settlement. Vi står for det it-setup, der ligger bag, når penge og værdipapirer skifter hænder på aktiemarkedet – sikkert og veldokumenteret.
Det er helt naturligt i vores hverdag, at vi deler det, vi ved, med hinanden. Vi har tillid til, at alle er kvalitetsbevidste og gør det godt, og eksperimenter er en fast del af vores hverdag. Og så er vi begejstrede for at arbejde med den nyeste teknologi og ivrige efter at afprøve flere nye ting.

75 % udvikling, 25 % support og 100 % faglig sparring
I en afvekslende kombination af soloarbejde, pair programming og mob programming indgår du i vores Scrum-team. Her skaber vi sammen gode, fremtidssikre løsninger og yder support på vores systemer.

”Vi er et stort hus, og hvis du kan sætte et positivt aftryk på andet end dit eget team, har du super gode muligheder for at få andre roller eller bevæge dig over i andre fagområder med tiden,” fortsætter Boye Nielsen.

En aktiv medspiller med styr på softwareudvikling

Derudover kommer du med en:
nyligt afsluttet uddannelse som softwareudvikler enten fra et universitet eller en professionshøjskole – hovedsagen er, at du har indsigt i moderne systemudvikling og udviklingsværktøjer
viden om Java, GIT, Angular, REST og continuous delivery  
interesse i at gå bagom kulisserne på kapitalmarkedet, men du behøver ikke at have brancheerfaring.

Interesseret?
Så send os din ansøgning hurtigst muligt, da vi kalder løbende til samtale.

214,Software Engineer,Proper,"Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark",Your profile matches this job,"Our Mission

Our mission is to make rental administration easy for tenants and landlords. Managing rental properties is complicated, whether you're managing a single property or hundreds. We have developed a platform that removes all the frustrations of being a landlord by leaning on technology, automation and amazing customer service. We want our landlords to spend their time adding value to their portfolios whilst making sure tenants have the best renting experience they can get.

Join our ambitious startup to make a real change in an industry that truly needs it.

Our Engineering Environment

We rely entirely on a serverless infrastructure on AWS. Most of our micro-services are written in Java, based on Clean Architecture and are event-based, using AWS Lambda, SQS, SNS, S3, and DynamoDB.

Our frontend is a React app based on Next.js, styled-components and our own component library built with Storybook – yes, everything is written in TypeScript.

We build our product through a process inspired by experiments. First, we test ideas, job stories and product market fit with a pretotype which is a quick experiment with little software. Once we have an understanding of the jobs-to-be-done and the market we either move on to a prototyping stage with a little more software, or straight to the ""real"" implementation. We learn a lot during these initial phases while using only limited resources. And we find that this process allows us to move fast and stay agile while giving us a high degree of confidence in the product we deliver. It's usually not possible in other industries, but in property management everything is handled manually so we are just as good as status quo.

The Product team uses Scrum. You will not be limited to a certain technology or area, but get responsibility across the product, and it is expected that you contribute to the team and use your skills broadly within the product team.

Needless to say, as we process the rent for thousands of homes and offices we are serious about security and privacy.

Competencies

As a person you thrive in a position where you have a lot of responsibility, work in a small team and also challenge the existing processes, the team, the product and yourself.

Ideally you have:
3-5 years of software development experience in Java and/or Typescript
Experience consuming and creating APIs
Experience with React and Next.js
Experience with (and contributing to) a component library
Experience with different testing strategies (unit testing and manual testing)
Worked with distributed systems and event based architecture
Ability to communicate well about your own code and others code
Some experience with AWS Lambda, SQS, SNS, and DynamoDB is welcomed.


What We Offer You

251,"Softwareudvikler med styrke i DevOps, Docker og Kubernetes - Aarhus",Mjølner Informatics,"Aarhus, Middle Jutland, Denmark",Your profile matches this job,"Vi søger en softwareudvikler med stærke DevOps muskler, som kan være med til at løfte området til nye højder hos Mjølner og vores kunder.

Som softwareudvikler med fokus på DevOps bliver du en del af vores backend afdeling, som i dag består af 27 passionerede kollegaer, der primært fokuserer på Java og .Net udvikling, sikkerhed, arkitektur og/eller DevOps samt en nærværende afdelingsleder, som i høj grad motiverer og sikrer din faglige udvikling. Dine fokusområder bliver som udgangspunkt udvikling i enten Java og/eller .net og DevOps på interne projekter, men også som ekstern konsulent hos vores kunder.

Din dagligdag hos Mjølner

Som softwareudvikler hos Mjølner vil du indgå i et internt team på et projekt i huset eller udstationeres på et projekt hos én af vores mange spændende kunder. Projekterne har ofte en varighed på 3-12 måneder og udføres i teams med høj diversitet. Du kommer derfor til at samarbejde tæt med dine dygtige kollegaer fra andre faggrupper, fx UX og frontendudviklere.

Hvis du kommer på et internt projekt, vil du typisk være med fra idé til det færdige digitale produkt. Du vil være eksperten på dit område og derfor også have en rådgivende rolle samt være med i beslutningstagningen omkring DevOps. Du vil arbejde sammen med engagererede og højt motiverede kollegaer, der hver især brænder for den gode digitale løsning.

Vi oplever stor efterspørgsel på DevOps kompetencer fra vores kunder, så kommer du på en udstationering, vil du typisk indgå i et igangværende projekt, hvor du er kaldt ind som eksperten eller for ekstra superpowers til at få løst nogle DevOps udfordringer. Her kan vi også garantere dig, at du vil komme på exceptionelt spændende og komplekse projekter.

Lige meget om du kommer på et internt eller eksternt projekt, vil du opleve stor frihed under ansvar, tillid frem for kontrol, vidensdeling i højsædet og en arbejdsuge på 37 timer.

Dine personlige kvalifikationer

Udvikling, DevOps, drift, automatisering, infrastruktur og cloud er meget gerne områder, du allerede har arbejdet meget med og kan i søvne.

Microservices, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Azure og AWS er blot en gruppe af teknologier, som du har stiftet bekendtskab med, også gerne på et niveau så du kan blære dig overfor dine kollegaer.

Vi ser gerne, at du kommer fra en videregående uddannelse som datalog eller softwareingeniør og har en lyst til at udvikle dig selv og dit fag i tæt samarbejde med dine kollegaer. Ideelt set har du allerede erfaring som softwareudvikler og er derfor helt rutineret i .Net og/eller Java udvikling, men det er din erfaring med DevOps, der er afgørende for os. Der er stor variation i de opgaver vi løser, derfor ansætter vi aldrig med kun ét projekt for øje. Det betyder også at vi i høj grad ansætter efter det potentiale vi ser i dig og ikke kun dine konkrete kompetencer.

Du er selvstændig og initiativrig og har et drive inden for alle faser i softwareudviklingsprocessen; fra analyse, krav og design over implementation til test, release og drift. Du trives i at have den daglige kontakt med kunden og udvikle samt rådgive om produktet i tæt samarbejde med kunden.

Sidst, men absolut ikke mindst, forventer vi at du er udadvendt og indstillet på at indgå i et meget socialt miljø, hvor vi griner højt og kan lave sjov med hinanden.

Hvad kan Mjølner tilbyde dig?

Som arbejdsplads tilbyder vi dygtige, kreative og frem for alt engagerede kollegaer. Vi har et højt niveau af vidensdeling på tværs af projekterne og en uformel omgangstone, der giver plads til diversitet og udvikling.

Mjølner har mere end 30 år på bagen, og er dermed et modent softwareudviklingshus. Dette kommer til udtryk i et højt fagligt niveau inden for projektdiscipliner som projektledelse, kravstyring, softwarearkitektur og brugervenlighed, og vi arbejder konstant på at mestre disse endnu bedre.

Vi er en fleksibel arbejdsplads, der rummer det hele menneske – vi har respekt for familie og fritid. Det betyder, at vi stoler på vores medarbejdere, der selv står til ansvar for deres arbejde.

Vores sociale fællesskab er stærkt, både i hverdagen og til vores mange sociale arrangementer. Vi har et fest-, fredagsbar-, sport-, film- og kulturudvalg, som finder på sjove arrangementer for os året rundt. Vi holder fx temafester, filmaftener i vores egen biograf, brætspilscafé, tager i teater og på travbanen og deltager i motions- og cykelløb. Er du til mere sport, har vi vores eget fitnessrum som mange kollegaer benytter sig af før, midt på eller efter arbejdsdagen.

Softwareudvikler med potentiale til arkitektrolle

8600, Silkeborg 

Kunne du tænke dig en betydningsfuld rolle for vores fremadrettede rejse inden for DevOps og fremtidens digitale bank? Og brænder du for microservices, micro frontends og at få mange teams til at lykkedes med at bidrage til den samme løsning?

”Det her job er en unik mulighed for at arbejde med spændende faglige udfordringer, vidensdeling imellem dygtige teams og ikke mindst for at prøve kræfter med arkitektrollen,” forklarer Rune Lippert, afdelingsleder – Relationsbank.

Ban vejen for fremtidens digitale bank
Som arkitekt får du – i tæt samarbejde med kompetente kolleger – ansvar for at udvikle vores digitale bank med fokus på selvbetjeningsløsninger og næste generation af Bankdatas mobile bank og netbank. Samtidig er du med til at supportere Bankdatas strategiske initiativer med henblik på opbygning af en DevOps-kultur. Derudover er det din opgave at skabe overblik over vores systemlandskab og ikke mindst skabe et netværk i Bankdata.

Et kig ind i fremtiden
Vi leder efter en kommunikativ stærk udvikler, der har prøvet eller ønsker at prøve kræfter med arkitektrollen. Du får flere dygtige og erfarne arkitekteter, der er klar til at give dig sparring og hjælpe dig til at blive en success i rollen.
Som arkitekt i Bankdata får du rig mulighed for at være med til at sætte dit præg på arkitekturen på tværs af Bankdata, og du kommer til at bidrage til den samlede arkitekturledelse af Bankdata, hvor vi netop står over for lanceringen af en spændende og ambitiøs 2025-strategi.
”Der er masser af mulighed for, at du kan udvikle dig til arkitekt og præge den tekniske arkitektur på tværs af Bankdata.” – Rune

Mange kompetente samarbejdspartnere
Du bliver en central del af Bankdatas nye Mobilbank, der allerede nu tæller en del udviklingteams. I løbet af den nærmeste fremtid er det vores ambition at blive et fagligt fællesskab på omkring 14 Scrum-teams. Stillingen giver dig et meget bredt samarbejde på tværs af Bankdata samt tæt dialog med kunder og interessenter.

Dine opgaver bliver blandt andet at:
deltage på tværs af vores udviklingssetup, afdelinger og forretningsinteressenter i forhold til tekniske problemstillinger
sikre god arkitektur omkring den digitale bank, både i forhold til programmet, men også i forhold til de teams i andre områder hos Bankdata og uden for Bankdata, der arbejder på relationsbanken
hjælpe med bedømmelse og udvælgelse af gode frameworks og libraries
håndtere løsningsdesign på nye features sammen med andre udviklingsteams
samarbejde ift. projektkoordinering og hjælpe med afklaring i forhold til kommende features og opgaver
skabe overblik over systemlandskab og organisationslandskab – integrationer, framework og teams (afdelinger og områder)
deltage aktivt i at sikre teknisk vidensdeling på tværs af teams inden for og uden for Bankdata, der arbejder på relationsbanken.

Forandringsagent med ambitioner
Det er et krav, at du har nogle års erfaring fra et agilt udviklingsteam og med udvikling af software, og det er en fordel, hvis du har erfaring som team lead, tech lead eller arkitekt, men det er bestemt ikke et krav. Så længe du har lyst til at prøve kræfter med arkitektrollen i tæt samspil med 2 dygtige kolleger.
Det er en fordel, hvis du har erfaring med native apps, hybrid apps og alternativ webudvikling.
Vi ser også gerne, at du måske har erfaring med kravsafklaring med domænespecialister, forretning og PO’er, ligesom du også gerne har erfaring med koordinering og samarbejde på tværs af flere udviklingsteams.
Det er et plus, hvis du har kendskab til Angular og SPA.

Som arkitekt i Bankdata er det vigtigt, at du har god forståelse for software udvikling, agile principper, og principper som microservices, DevOps og continuous delivery. Desuden er det vigtigt, at du trives med en central rolle, hvor der er meget kommunikation og en del tværgående koordinering. Vi starter dig op i et softwareteam, så du lærer løsningen og Bankdata at kende, men stille og roligt forventer vi, at arkitektrollen vil fylde mere og mere af din dagligdag.

Som person er du kommunikativ stærk, og du trives med at stille dig op på ølkassen og sprede viden samt koordinere opgaver på kryds og tværs. Du er i stand til at formidle komplekse tekniske problemstillinger på tværs af forretning og udviklingsteams både inden for og uden for Bankdata. Desuden følger du med i udviklingen inden for udviklingsprincipper, frameworks og tools, og endelig har du gennemslagskraft over for både kolleger, interessenter og ledelse.

Vil du vide mere?
Har du spørgsmål til jobbet, er du velkommen til at kontakte afdelingsleder Rune Lippert på rli@bankdata.dk. Du søger stillingen ved at sende din ansøgning og dit CV via linket her på siden. Vi inviterer løbende kandidater til samtale, så søg stillingen hurtigst muligt og senest d. 15.03.2021.

Vi glæder os til at høre fra dig!
Bankdata er ejet af 8 pengeinstitutter og er med sine godt 800 ansatte en af landets største IT-arbejdspladser. Vi tilbyder stor frihed i jobbet, personlige udviklingsmuligheder, en række personalemæssige goder og en løn, der matcher jobbet. Analyser viser, at vi har nogle af landets mest tilfredse medarbejdere, og du kan læse meget mere om, hvad nogle af dem siger om at arbejde hos Bankdata.

The latter in a modern .NET-based solution with a strong focus on code reviews, unit testing, quality, and continuous improvement.

It is only a short step from development to production, and the systems handle large customer portfolios and depots, just as they integrate into a multitude of surrounding systems, which puts high demands on precision, and cooperation across the department. We use scrum and an agile set-up, and we believe that producing frequent prototypes for our customers and a customer-driven test will create the best solutions.

About You

We expect that you:
Hold a degree of Master in Software Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, actuary or a similar discipline – your experience is far more important than your specific educational background
Have a solid knowledge of agile development and understand how to utilize the functionality to the utmost
Have experience with version-driven development in .NET and C#. Knowledge of Visual Studio, Unit test as well as experience with SQL is a great advantage
Have experience from the life and pension industry or perhaps from the financial sector
Follow the technological developments and in particular the development of principles of best practices in IT development
Have a consultative and commercial mindset
Can create and keep an overview – also under pressure
Are a fast learner and are not afraid of large code bases
Master the Danish as well as the English language at a professional level.
Furthermore, We Like You To Be
A team player that is motivated by working closely together with highly skilled colleagues and customers
Curious, open, ambitious, and cooperative with a positive mindset
High standards for quality
What can you expect?

Edlund is an exciting workplace where you become a part of an informal environment, with special emphasis on high professionalism and sparring from deeply committed and skilled colleagues. As an employee, you are valued, and the working environment has a high priority. To create good results, we also have to work well together socially. We place great demands on your personal and professional skills, but at the same time we offer exciting challenges in an informal and unbureaucratic organization, where we consider the workplace a good place to be. We firmly believe that there must be a balance between personal and professional life. For that reason, we have a full flex scheme and aim for a 35-hour working week on average. In addition, we offer a good salary, profit sharing, health insurance, and pension.

Are you ready for Edlund?

Please send us your application and your CV as soon as possible and no later than July 5th. We will call in for interviews on an ongoing basis. If you have any questions about the job, please contact either Recruitment Partner Marianne Aili Nilsson on mobile no. 91 37 57 39 until the 2nd of July or Professional Service Director Helle Dalgaard on mobile no. 27 84 24 23

270,Software Engineer for a new music streaming service,Speedrecruiters,"København, Capital Region, Denmark",Your profile matches this job,"Software Engineer for music streaming service in Copenhagen

Why You Want To Work With Us

We are building a personalized music streaming service and are launching globally. We need you and your expertise to join us in improving and expanding the Moodagent services, enabling us to bring better music to even more people. Check out:

We have all the things you know and love: Music, Big Data, Microservice APIs, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Massively Scalable Systems, and an ever-flowing stream of delightfully intricate challenges of making these things come together as a whole. And great people on top of that!

About You

You hold a degree in Computer Science or something similar, and some of these topics should ring your proverbial bell: C#, Python, Docker, Cloud Computing, REST, Big Data, Document Databases, Disco, Dubstep, or Death metal.

You enjoy taking on challenges that have no easy solutions, in close collaboration with your colleagues. You know the right way to do things, but also when to deviate from the established paths in favor of more unorthodox solutions. You thrive in an environment where we plan but also change those plans whenever we learn something new.

The Job

You’d be working as a developer in one of our domain teams, focusing mainly on our internal and external REST APIs. Your preferred language of expression should probably be C# or Python. Knowledge of databases is a huge plus. On the other hand, the teams are cross-functional and comprise data scientists, musicologists, and everything in between. So you shouldn’t be afraid to apply any expertise you have to any task that would benefit from it. Or to dip your toes into new pools of knowledge.

We Offer

A diverse team of colleagues from more than 15 different countries
Friday bars, a summer party & holiday gathering (all covid permitting)

As our new colleague, you will expand your knowledge about trading activities, with an emphasis on trading of gas in Europe. We will invite you to bring your experience into action on many very interesting projects.

Another example is algorithmic trading, which provides DC with an edge when it comes to efficiently reacting to real-time changes in a very volatile market – a market where microseconds may determine if DC makes a trade. You will also be introduced to the mechanics of trading on exchanges or between brokers across Europe.

Down the road, your journey will allow you to utilise your education and experience with respect to software design and development, including the entire process from idea inception to development, extending and maintaining our software.

Developer – skab de bedste digitale barrierer mod finansiel kriminalitet

7000, Fredericia

Kunne du tænke dig at udvikle software i et helt særligt og intenst forretningsområde, som har stor efterspørgsel fra vores kunder – de danske pengeinstitutter – og høj bevågenhed fra myndighederne?

”I det her job er du direkte med til at udvikle barrierer mod hvidvask- og terroraktiviteter. Og der er gode muligheder for at præge og udvikle de løsninger, der dækker vores kunders behov – og udvikle scenarier, der ultimativt er med til at fange flere kriminelle på det finansielle område,” fortæller Torsten Vestergaard Meyer, scrum master – Netbank & AML. 

Arbejd fokuseret med Bankdatas antihvidvask- og antiterrorsystemer
Som vores nye udvikler fokuserer du på antihvidvask og antiterror, hvor du får ansvar for at administrere, vedligeholde og udvikle systemerne. Vi arbejder med tredjepartssystemer, hvor vi skal sikre integration. Med andre ord: Du får data til at hænge sammen og skaber de bedste digitale barrierer mod finansiel kriminalitet.

Din hverdag vil primært bestå af udvikling i SAS Software/SAS AML. Her ser vi på, hvordan vi bedst møder vores kunders behov, og det vil altid være en team effort med både konsulenter og udviklere involveret. Fordi vi arbejder med DevOps, vil du også være med inde over hele løsningen, fra første scenarie til løsningen er i drift og skal vedligeholdes.
”Vi har nogle rigtig spændende initiativer i pipelinen – bl.a. at omlægge vores datatræk væk fra enterprise data warehouse og nyudvikle standardscenarier til vores kundekreds for at afdække risici. Vi arbejder agilt og har fokus på kunderne, så du skal være forberedt på en omskiftelig hverdag men også en masse læring,” fortæller Torsten.
 Udvikl dine kompetencer – og bekæmp digital kriminalitet
Inden for de første par måneder kommer du ind under huden på Bankdatas kultur, arbejdsprocesser og samarbejdspartnere. Og vi skræddersyer et personligt onboarding-program til dig, ligesom du får en fast ”buddy”, som tager godt hånd om din indflyvning til teamet og de mange spændende opgaver, der venter dig.

Vi vil være en af de førende i Danmark og sætte dagsordenen, når det handler om at bekæmpe digital kriminalitet i den finansielle sektor. Det betyder, at der står en masse døre på klem for dig rent udviklingsmæssigt, som du selv skal være med til at åbne. Mulighederne er mange, og det er i princippet kun dig selv, der sætter begrænsningerne.

Velkommen til Antihvidvask og Antiterror Teamet (AML) i Fredericia
I 2020 blev et selvstændigt AML Scrum team i Fredericia etableret, hvor vi nu er 10 kolleger fordelt på konsulenter og udviklere, som, der har fokus på antihvidvask og antiterror. Sammen arbejder vi efter agile principper for at øge værdien af den software, vi udvikler, der i sidste ende er med til at standse finansiel kriminalitet.
”Målet er at etablere et high-performance team. Det vil vi gøre igennem tæt samarbejde og en åben dialog. Det er en vigtig del af vores dagligdag, når vi ejer hele ansvaret for løsningerne i forhold til DevOps. Det giver en masse erfaring, som du kan få gavn af,” slutter Torsten.
 Har du SAS-erfaring – eller lysten til at opbygge den?
Vigtigst er det, at du er nysgerrig, en holdspiller af natur og ikke mindst motiveret for skabe din egen udviklingsprogression, for der er gode muligheder for at bygge på dine kompetencer. Derfor er det også vigtigt, at du kommer med god energi, tager ansvar for opgaverne og følger dem helt til dørs – sammen med teamet. Derudover forestiller vi os, at du:
har teknisk viden om SAS Software – eller lysten til at opbygge den viden
har erfaring med patch management og rollen som bindeled mellem interne og eksterne leverandører
formentlig er uddannet datamatiker, datalog eller IT-ingeniør krydret med erfaring fra COBOL og/eller Java samt decentrale platforme (som eksempelvis Linux-, Windows- og SQL-servere)
måske har viden fra den finansielle sektor.

Interesseret?
Har du spørgsmål til jobbet, er du velkommen til at kontakte scrum master Torsten Vestergaard Meyer på: 7924 2420 eller tme@bankdata.dk. Vi inviterer løbende kandidater til samtale, så søg allerede i dag.

Vi glæder os til at høre fra dig!
Bankdata er ejet af 8 pengeinstitutter og er med sine godt 800 ansatte en af landets største IT-arbejdspladser. Vi tilbyder stor frihed i jobbet, personlige udviklingsmuligheder, en række personalemæssige goder og en løn, der matcher jobbet. Analyser viser, at vi har nogle af landets mest tilfredse medarbejdere, og du kan læse meget mere om, hvad nogle af dem siger om at arbejde hos Bankdata.

Why You Want To Work With Us

We are building a personalized music streaming service and are launching globally. We need you and your expertise to join us in improving and expanding the Moodagent services, enabling us to bring better music to even more people. Check out:

We have all the things you know and love: Music, Big Data, Microservice APIs, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Massively Scalable Systems, and an ever-flowing stream of delightfully intricate challenges of making these things come together as a whole. And great people on top of that!

About You

You hold a degree in Computer Science or something similar, and some of these topics should ring your proverbial bell: C#, Python, Docker, Cloud Computing, REST, Big Data, Document Databases, Disco, Dubstep, or Death metal.

You enjoy taking on challenges that have no easy solutions, in close collaboration with your colleagues. You know the right way to do things, but also when to deviate from the established paths in favor of more unorthodox solutions. You thrive in an environment where we plan but also change those plans whenever we learn something new.

The Job

You’d be working as a developer in one of our domain teams, focusing mainly on our internal and external REST APIs. Your preferred language of expression should probably be C# or Python. Knowledge of databases is a huge plus. On the other hand, the teams are cross-functional and comprise data scientists, musicologists, and everything in between. So you shouldn’t be afraid to apply any expertise you have to any task that would benefit from it. Or to dip your toes into new pools of knowledge.

We shape the business by delivering systems that give Danske Commodities (DC) competitive advantages and automate critical processes. We engage with the business as a trusted partner and advisor on technical solutions, and we develop world-class software using modern technology and practices.

The team is responsible for providing high availability systems that are capable of handling large data volumes from the trading activities.

You will also be introduced to the mechanics of trading on exchanges or between brokers across Europe.

Down the road, your journey will allow you to utilise your education and experience with respect to software design and development, including the entire process from idea inception to development, extending and maintaining our software.

”Du vil hurtigt få ansvar og opleve en stejl læringskurve her i Kapitalmarked Basis. Her udvikler og vedligeholder vi nemlig grundstammen af IT-systemer for nogle af Danmarks største pengeinstitutter – så du bliver en del af lidt af et brændpunkt, men på den fede måde, fordi andre er afhængige af dig og din ekspertise,” fortæller Helene Samuelsen, som er afdelingsleder for Depot.

Få indblik i komplekse udviklingsopgaver
Som software developer i Kapitalmarkedsområdet bliver du en del af Bankdatas Custody team. Et stærkt team med et stort engagement, hvor du vil komme til at samarbejde med erfarne og dygtige kolleger.
Vi er et velfungerende hold med stort fokus på arbejdsglæde, sparring og holdånd – vi hjælper hinanden og holder sammen i tykt og tyndt.
”Du kan forvente at få frie tøjler inden for de rammer, der er, og fuld opbakning til de valg, du træffer. Jeg forventer, at alle laver fejl – og lærer af dem,” udtaler afdelingsleder Helene Samuelsen.
Teamet er et ud af 12 teams på kapitalmarkedsområdet som udgør fundamentet af IT-systemer vedr. handel og administration af aktier og obligationer for nogle af Danmarks største pengeinstitutter. Teamet har base i Fredericia, hvor du også vil få arbejdssted.

Vi arbejder blandt andet med udvikling af Backend, Frontend, API’er, PaaS og Microservices og vi benytter eksempelvis følgende teknologier Cobol, Java, Angular, Rest og Jenkins hvortil et godt kendskab vil være en klar fordel.

Vores løsninger er komplekse, og det indebærer fokus på software af høj kvalitet. Vores produkt er centralt i pengeinstitutternes strategi, og derfor er leverancer til tiden og faglig sparring på et højt niveau en forudsætning.

Opgaverne vil blandt andet omfatte nyudvikling af IT-løsninger, afklaring af forretningens behov og udfordringer, test og efterfølgende support af systemer.

For os er dine sociale færdigheder lige så vigtige som dine faglige kompetencer. Som person er du selvstændig, engageret med et stort drive, og kan håndtere både ansvar og frie arbejdsrammer. Du har et godt humør og gode samarbejdsevner, så du kan fungere som en aktiv medspiller i teamet og i dialog med pengeinstitutterne.

Forretningsforståelse og Java-erfaring
Vi leder efter en kollega, der har en kombination af forretningsindsigt og Java-udviklingskompetencer. Du behøver ikke have lige godt kendskab til begge felter, for vi sørger for de nødvendige kurser og oplæring.
Du har minimum et par års erfaring med java-programmering, med baggrund i enten en relevant it-uddannelse, eller solid erfaring med Java-programmering.
Du har erfaring med Git, ApiGee, Postman, Angular og Rest eller lignende værktøjer.
Et analytisk mindset og formår at nedbryde problemstillinger til håndterbare størrelser.
Du kan drive opgaver og vidensdele dem med teamet, ligesom du er villig til at undervise andre.
Det er en fordel du besidder viden om kapitalmarkedet men ikke et krav, du skal dog have lyst til at tilegne dig den viden.
Da vi arbejder med Scrum er det vigtigt du er proces orienteret i løsningen af opgaver og vil lære af den. 

Vil du vide mere?
Har du spørgsmål til jobbet, er du velkommen til at kontakte afdelingsleder Helene Samuelsen på 28 30 91 79 / hlk@bankdata.dk

289,Software Engineer,Lunar,"Aarhus, Middle Jutland, Denmark",Your profile matches this job,"Do you want to start your career in a place where you can help build a bank from scratch and learn from the best - wild, right? Do your eyes sparkle when we tell you that you can become a part of a hyper growth journey that requires the ability to learn fast and immerse yourself into the newest technologies? Can you see yourself as the backend competence in a squad, where you have to help set new standards for how to make and use financial products?

Is your head tired of nodding up and down? 
Then you should become our new Software Engineer. 

Glimpse into our tech 
Our technical platform is based on an event-based microservice architecture, where continuous and independent deployability is a must. We are pushing around 1000 releases a month to our users. We host our infrastructure in AWS and orchestrate our microservices via Kubernetes - and everything else that goes hand in hand with cloud native technologies. Our primary language is Go, but we also believe in ""the right tool for the job"". 

How we work 
At Lunar we do things simultaneously and at a fast pace - and to be able to do so, our engineering culture has to be based on an agile mindset. We are organised within squads that are divided into different sub-domains, making it possible for each squad to be on their own mission - and thereby enabling us to work autonomously. At Lunar, we pursue a culture that enables people to “think differently” and take ownership in their work-life here. At Lunar, responsibility is not something you get - it is something you take. 

Your pitch 
You may not be able to fill two A4 pages with your experience. However, you have the drive and desire to work with software in an organization where only you set the limits yourself. At the same time, you are not afraid to roll up your sleeves and give it your all. You want to learn and be part of a team where your goal is to deliver world-class experiences to our users.
Your ambitions are high, and you love to be challenged in your day-to-day life, both by skilled colleagues and exciting issues that need an ingenious solution. You want to help build robust software, where you need to focus just as much on error handling as sunshine scenarios. Your interests and competencies are within backend development, and you want to be in an organization where you have the opportunity to develop these even further.

You should definitely apply if you:
Wish to help us to scale our solutions, architecture, and design so that we can keep up with the growth in the number of users.
Want to be a key person in a strategically important team, where you help create the products that help realize our ambition of becoming the new bank of the Nordics.  
Would like to be part of a flat organization where you get the chance to contribute from day one.
Can see yourself contributing in creating innovative solutions, which set and enable new standards for user experience and satisfaction when it comes to financial products. 

Your skills & interests 
At Lunar, nothing is typical. Yet we have an idea of what a “typical” candidate in this position might look like. If you can check several things off the list - that would be great!
You have a relevant degree in Computer Science or Engineering, etc.
You have knowledge and perhaps some experience with; Go, .NET or JAVA. 
You are curious about microservice architecture, messaging, Docker, Kubernetes and would like to learn more. 
You might have some knowledge of; event sourcing, Grafana, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, design and develop secure systems.

 What’s in it for you?
You’ll make your mark on the new digital bank in the Nordics, and your daily work-life will be in our awesome office in the middle of Aarhus (Dokk1 is our neighbor) 
You’ll try a bunch of different things, with more new stuff to come.
Get great sparring with brilliant colleagues and the possibility to grow.
Casual tone, lots of laughs, and room for diversity. 
You’ll be a part of an entrepreneurial company full of drive and with great team spirit. Together we’ve already accomplished wonderful results, and we’re nowhere near done. 
At Lunar, we emphasize follow-up on the things we do, so we’re always learning - both as individuals and as a team.

We love diversity and all that sets us apart - that's what makes us awesome. Some are extroverted - some introverted. We don't all speak Danish, Norwegian or Swedish, but we all speak English. The most important thing is respect and understanding between one and another.

Does it sound like something right up your alley?
Then don't hesitate to apply and maybe you will become our new colleague. 
Feel free to reach out to our Recruitment Specialist, Louise Bjerregaard Andersen if you have any questions - her email is Lan@lunar.app. 

Together with your CV, we would also like to get your diploma, and if you have a Github profile - don't hesitate to share it with us!

291,"Softwareudvikler med styrke i DevOps, Docker og Kubernetes - Aarhus",Mjølner Informatics,"Aarhus, Middle Jutland, Denmark",Your profile matches this job,"Vi søger en softwareudvikler med stærke DevOps muskler, som kan være med til at løfte området til nye højder hos Mjølner og vores kunder.

Som softwareudvikler med fokus på DevOps bliver du en del af vores backend afdeling, som i dag består af 27 passionerede kollegaer, der primært fokuserer på Java og .Net udvikling, sikkerhed, arkitektur og/eller DevOps samt en nærværende afdelingsleder, som i høj grad motiverer og sikrer din faglige udvikling. Dine fokusområder bliver som udgangspunkt udvikling i enten Java og/eller .net og DevOps på interne projekter, men også som ekstern konsulent hos vores kunder.

Din dagligdag hos Mjølner

Som softwareudvikler hos Mjølner vil du indgå i et internt team på et projekt i huset eller udstationeres på et projekt hos én af vores mange spændende kunder. Projekterne har ofte en varighed på 3-12 måneder og udføres i teams med høj diversitet. Du kommer derfor til at samarbejde tæt med dine dygtige kollegaer fra andre faggrupper, fx UX og frontendudviklere.

Hvis du kommer på et internt projekt, vil du typisk være med fra idé til det færdige digitale produkt. Du vil være eksperten på dit område og derfor også have en rådgivende rolle samt være med i beslutningstagningen omkring DevOps. Du vil arbejde sammen med engagererede og højt motiverede kollegaer, der hver især brænder for den gode digitale løsning.

Vi oplever stor efterspørgsel på DevOps kompetencer fra vores kunder, så kommer du på en udstationering, vil du typisk indgå i et igangværende projekt, hvor du er kaldt ind som eksperten eller for ekstra superpowers til at få løst nogle DevOps udfordringer. Her kan vi også garantere dig, at du vil komme på exceptionelt spændende og komplekse projekter.

Lige meget om du kommer på et internt eller eksternt projekt, vil du opleve stor frihed under ansvar, tillid frem for kontrol, vidensdeling i højsædet og en arbejdsuge på 37 timer.

Dine personlige kvalifikationer

Udvikling, DevOps, drift, automatisering, infrastruktur og cloud er meget gerne områder, du allerede har arbejdet meget med og kan i søvne.

Microservices, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Azure og AWS er blot en gruppe af teknologier, som du har stiftet bekendtskab med, også gerne på et niveau så du kan blære dig overfor dine kollegaer.

Vi ser gerne, at du kommer fra en videregående uddannelse som datalog eller softwareingeniør og har en lyst til at udvikle dig selv og dit fag i tæt samarbejde med dine kollegaer. Ideelt set har du allerede erfaring som softwareudvikler og er derfor helt rutineret i .Net og/eller Java udvikling, men det er din erfaring med DevOps, der er afgørende for os. Der er stor variation i de opgaver vi løser, derfor ansætter vi aldrig med kun ét projekt for øje. Det betyder også at vi i høj grad ansætter efter det potentiale vi ser i dig og ikke kun dine konkrete kompetencer.

Du er selvstændig og initiativrig og har et drive inden for alle faser i softwareudviklingsprocessen; fra analyse, krav og design over implementation til test, release og drift. Du trives i at have den daglige kontakt med kunden og udvikle samt rådgive om produktet i tæt samarbejde med kunden.

Sidst, men absolut ikke mindst, forventer vi at du er udadvendt og indstillet på at indgå i et meget socialt miljø, hvor vi griner højt og kan lave sjov med hinanden.

Hvad kan Mjølner tilbyde dig?

Som arbejdsplads tilbyder vi dygtige, kreative og frem for alt engagerede kollegaer. Vi har et højt niveau af vidensdeling på tværs af projekterne og en uformel omgangstone, der giver plads til diversitet og udvikling.

Mjølner har mere end 30 år på bagen, og er dermed et modent softwareudviklingshus. Dette kommer til udtryk i et højt fagligt niveau inden for projektdiscipliner som projektledelse, kravstyring, softwarearkitektur og brugervenlighed, og vi arbejder konstant på at mestre disse endnu bedre.

Vi er en fleksibel arbejdsplads, der rummer det hele menneske – vi har respekt for familie og fritid. Det betyder, at vi stoler på vores medarbejdere, der selv står til ansvar for deres arbejde.

Vores sociale fællesskab er stærkt, både i hverdagen og til vores mange sociale arrangementer. Vi har et fest-, fredagsbar-, sport-, film- og kulturudvalg, som finder på sjove arrangementer for os året rundt. Vi holder fx temafester, filmaftener i vores egen biograf, brætspilscafé, tager i teater og på travbanen og deltager i motions- og cykelløb. Er du til mere sport, har vi vores eget fitnessrum som mange kollegaer benytter sig af før, midt på eller efter arbejdsdagen.

Developer – skab de bedste digitale barrierer mod finansiel kriminalitet

7000, Fredericia

Kunne du tænke dig at udvikle software i et helt særligt og intenst forretningsområde, som har stor efterspørgsel fra vores kunder – de danske pengeinstitutter – og høj bevågenhed fra myndighederne?

”I det her job er du direkte med til at udvikle barrierer mod hvidvask- og terroraktiviteter. Og der er gode muligheder for at præge og udvikle de løsninger, der dækker vores kunders behov – og udvikle scenarier, der ultimativt er med til at fange flere kriminelle på det finansielle område,” fortæller Torsten Vestergaard Meyer, scrum master – Netbank & AML. 

Arbejd fokuseret med Bankdatas antihvidvask- og antiterrorsystemer
Som vores nye udvikler fokuserer du på antihvidvask og antiterror, hvor du får ansvar for at administrere, vedligeholde og udvikle systemerne. Vi arbejder med tredjepartssystemer, hvor vi skal sikre integration. Med andre ord: Du får data til at hænge sammen og skaber de bedste digitale barrierer mod finansiel kriminalitet.

Din hverdag vil primært bestå af udvikling i SAS Software/SAS AML. Her ser vi på, hvordan vi bedst møder vores kunders behov, og det vil altid være en team effort med både konsulenter og udviklere involveret. Fordi vi arbejder med DevOps, vil du også være med inde over hele løsningen, fra første scenarie til løsningen er i drift og skal vedligeholdes.
”Vi har nogle rigtig spændende initiativer i pipelinen – bl.a. at omlægge vores datatræk væk fra enterprise data warehouse og nyudvikle standardscenarier til vores kundekreds for at afdække risici. Vi arbejder agilt og har fokus på kunderne, så du skal være forberedt på en omskiftelig hverdag men også en masse læring,” fortæller Torsten.
 Udvikl dine kompetencer – og bekæmp digital kriminalitet
Inden for de første par måneder kommer du ind under huden på Bankdatas kultur, arbejdsprocesser og samarbejdspartnere. Og vi skræddersyer et personligt onboarding-program til dig, ligesom du får en fast ”buddy”, som tager godt hånd om din indflyvning til teamet og de mange spændende opgaver, der venter dig.

Vi vil være en af de førende i Danmark og sætte dagsordenen, når det handler om at bekæmpe digital kriminalitet i den finansielle sektor. Det betyder, at der står en masse døre på klem for dig rent udviklingsmæssigt, som du selv skal være med til at åbne. Mulighederne er mange, og det er i princippet kun dig selv, der sætter begrænsningerne.

Velkommen til Antihvidvask og Antiterror Teamet (AML) i Fredericia
I 2020 blev et selvstændigt AML Scrum team i Fredericia etableret, hvor vi nu er 10 kolleger fordelt på konsulenter og udviklere, som, der har fokus på antihvidvask og antiterror. Sammen arbejder vi efter agile principper for at øge værdien af den software, vi udvikler, der i sidste ende er med til at standse finansiel kriminalitet.
”Målet er at etablere et high-performance team. Det vil vi gøre igennem tæt samarbejde og en åben dialog. Det er en vigtig del af vores dagligdag, når vi ejer hele ansvaret for løsningerne i forhold til DevOps. Det giver en masse erfaring, som du kan få gavn af,” slutter Torsten.
 Har du SAS-erfaring – eller lysten til at opbygge den?
Vigtigst er det, at du er nysgerrig, en holdspiller af natur og ikke mindst motiveret for skabe din egen udviklingsprogression, for der er gode muligheder for at bygge på dine kompetencer. Derfor er det også vigtigt, at du kommer med god energi, tager ansvar for opgaverne og følger dem helt til dørs – sammen med teamet. Derudover forestiller vi os, at du:
har teknisk viden om SAS Software – eller lysten til at opbygge den viden
har erfaring med patch management og rollen som bindeled mellem interne og eksterne leverandører
formentlig er uddannet datamatiker, datalog eller IT-ingeniør krydret med erfaring fra COBOL og/eller Java samt decentrale platforme (som eksempelvis Linux-, Windows- og SQL-servere)
måske har viden fra den finansielle sektor.

Erfaren Java software developer med stort fagligt og personligt potentiale til kapitalmarkedsområdet

7000, Fredericia

Motiveres du af at arbejde i et spændende og komplekst forretningsområde, hvor du kan udvikle dig til at blive fagekspert? Så bliv en del af Bankdata – her keder vi os sjældent. Du bliver en del af et komplekst forretningsområde og kommer både til at arbejde med PaaS, COBOL, Angular, REST og Java.

”Du vil hurtigt få ansvar og opleve en stejl læringskurve her i Kapitalmarked Basis. Her udvikler og vedligeholder vi nemlig grundstammen af IT-systemer for nogle af Danmarks største pengeinstitutter – så du bliver en del af lidt af et brændpunkt, men på den fede måde, fordi andre er afhængige af dig og din ekspertise,” fortæller Helene Samuelsen, som er afdelingsleder for Depot.

Få indblik i komplekse udviklingsopgaver
Som software developer i Kapitalmarkedsområdet bliver du en del af Bankdatas Custody team. Et stærkt team med et stort engagement, hvor du vil komme til at samarbejde med erfarne og dygtige kolleger.
Vi er et velfungerende hold med stort fokus på arbejdsglæde, sparring og holdånd – vi hjælper hinanden og holder sammen i tykt og tyndt.
”Du kan forvente at få frie tøjler inden for de rammer, der er, og fuld opbakning til de valg, du træffer. Jeg forventer, at alle laver fejl – og lærer af dem,” udtaler afdelingsleder Helene Samuelsen.
Teamet er et ud af 12 teams på kapitalmarkedsområdet som udgør fundamentet af IT-systemer vedr. handel og administration af aktier og obligationer for nogle af Danmarks største pengeinstitutter. Teamet har base i Fredericia, hvor du også vil få arbejdssted.

Vi arbejder blandt andet med udvikling af Backend, Frontend, API’er, PaaS og Microservices og vi benytter eksempelvis følgende teknologier Cobol, Java, Angular, Rest og Jenkins hvortil et godt kendskab vil være en klar fordel.

Vores løsninger er komplekse, og det indebærer fokus på software af høj kvalitet. Vores produkt er centralt i pengeinstitutternes strategi, og derfor er leverancer til tiden og faglig sparring på et højt niveau en forudsætning.

Opgaverne vil blandt andet omfatte nyudvikling af IT-løsninger, afklaring af forretningens behov og udfordringer, test og efterfølgende support af systemer.

Aktiv medspiller med stort drive
Vi arbejder agilt ud fra metoden Scrum og du vil indgå i et Scrum team på 8 kolleger. I tæt samarbejde med Product owner, Scrum master og de andre team members vil I levere værdifulde løsninger til pengeinstitutterne.
For os er dine sociale færdigheder lige så vigtige som dine faglige kompetencer. Som person er du selvstændig, engageret med et stort drive, og kan håndtere både ansvar og frie arbejdsrammer. Du har et godt humør og gode samarbejdsevner, så du kan fungere som en aktiv medspiller i teamet og i dialog med pengeinstitutterne.

Forretningsforståelse og Java-erfaring
Vi leder efter en kollega, der har en kombination af forretningsindsigt og Java-udviklingskompetencer. Du behøver ikke have lige godt kendskab til begge felter, for vi sørger for de nødvendige kurser og oplæring.
Du har minimum et par års erfaring med java-programmering, med baggrund i enten en relevant it-uddannelse, eller solid erfaring med Java-programmering.
Du har erfaring med Git, ApiGee, Postman, Angular og Rest eller lignende værktøjer.
Et analytisk mindset og formår at nedbryde problemstillinger til håndterbare størrelser.
Du kan drive opgaver og vidensdele dem med teamet, ligesom du er villig til at undervise andre.
Det er en fordel du besidder viden om kapitalmarkedet men ikke et krav, du skal dog have lyst til at tilegne dig den viden.
Da vi arbejder med Scrum er det vigtigt du er proces orienteret i løsningen af opgaver og vil lære af den. 

Vil du vide mere?
Har du spørgsmål til jobbet, er du velkommen til at kontakte afdelingsleder Helene Samuelsen på 28 30 91 79 / hlk@bankdata.dk
Du søger stillingen ved at sende din ansøgning og dit CV via linket her på siden. Vi inviterer løbende kandidater til samtale, så send din ansøgning hurtigst muligt. Vi forventer at holde samtaler løbende.

312,Software Engineer,Lunar,Copenhagen Metropolitan Area,Actively recruiting,"Do you have what it takes to be part of building the new bank of the Nordics? Do you have the brains, guts and team spirit to take Lunar to the next level? Are you ready to be a Backend Engineer in one of our first squads in Copenhagen while working with our tech superstars from Aarhus as well? 
If so, then let us know you are up to the challenge by applying now 💪

Squad, What? - our organisation
At Lunar, we work in squads. A squad consists of cross-disciplinary members who make up all the skills needed to complete the mission: developers, line-of-business, QA or subject matter experts. Squad members are handpicked throughout all departments in the company to ensure we achieve our missions. 
The squad is fully self-driven and takes complete responsibility for what they create. Each squad has a mission and will stop at nothing to complete it. To do that they have the full empowerment and freedom to execute in any way they wish. It is in the squads the magic happens.
Currently, we have four squads in Copenhagen, each of them with a unique and important mission: 
Voyager: Without Voyager, Lunar can not support customers.
Surveyor: Without Surveyor, Lunar can not use the power of advanced tech to fight financial crime.
Pioneer: Without Pioneer, Lunar can not scale with reason. 
Rosetta: Without Rosetta, Lunar can not run a banking operation.
And this is just the beginning....

A look under the hood - our tech
We have built our internal technology platform on an event-based microservice architecture and have about 250 of them running. Continuous and independent deployability is crucial, as we release about 1000 times to production a month. We aim to be multi-cloud, but with most of our services running in Kubernetes on AWS. We love GoLang but honestly believe in using the right tool for the job: Python, JavaScript, or whatever else gets the job done.
At Lunar, we build the rocket ship while we race to the moon and beyond. To do that, we simultaneously expand our offerings and features while we maintain a solid, optimised and scalable platform for our more than 250.000 customers. It requires steady nerves and a super steady focus doing that.

Your elevator-pitch
You have the drive and ambition to develop software, where only you and your squad set the limits. You have a unique set of technical skills to add to the already impressive brainpower we have at Lunar. You are prepared to challenge the norms and know that the best argument is vital. You are a team player and not necessarily the rockstar that craves the lime-light but also enjoys being one of the unsung heroes backstage. Your focus is on backend development and maybe you have a passion for data and its usage. You have experience that you want to utilize at Lunar, but you also love to learn and grow. 

So, what do we need?
Even though there is absolutely nothing typical about Lunar, we still have a pretty good idea of what a ""typical"" backender looks like: 
You have at least three years of experience from a role similar to what we are looking for - not necessarily from the same industry.
You have an education within Computer Science, Engineering or Data Science, or experience from ""the School of Life"" that is equal.
It is a must that you have experience with some part of the tech stack. That being Go programming, RabbitMQ, Event Sourcing, Grafana, Data engineering, GraphQL, Microservice architecture, or any other aspects that will ensure that the squad can complete the mission from a technical point of view.
You don't look away when somebody needs help, but you know when to interfere and when not to.
You don't take yourself too seriously and have an open mind.

What's in it for you?
You will have the unique opportunity to be part of building up not only the new bank of the Nordics but also the brand new Tech-hub from our excellent offices in central Copenhagen.
You will be part of a bunch of intelligent techies and ambitious financial nerds from whom you will learn from and grow every day. 
You will be part of an informal organisation, where it is not the ironing of your shirt or your title that gives you the mandate to have an opinion but your arguments and passion for continually improving.
You will become part of a company that wants to make sure that you are well mentally and physically. This means that Yoga and meditation are encouraged throughout work hours, and if that is not your thing, we have padel tournaments, board games, cycling clubs and much more that you can take part in.

We love diversity and everything that makes us different from everybody else because that makes us extraordinary. We come from all kinds of backgrounds, and speak all kinds of languages, so English is our business language. Our most important value is respect and understanding because only with that mindset can we move forward with supersonic speed.

Are you ready to be part of the journey? 
If you want to be part of Lunar, a place where passion and opinions matter, and we strive for nothing less than awesomeness, then get in touch with us, and become part of one of our fantastic squads.

If you have any questions regarding the position, please contact Head of Technology, Anders Kring at akk@lunar.app, and he will try to answer your questions.

Erfaren Java software developer med stort fagligt og personligt potentiale til kapitalmarkedsområdet

7000, Fredericia

Motiveres du af at arbejde i et spændende og komplekst forretningsområde, hvor du kan udvikle dig til at blive fagekspert? Så bliv en del af Bankdata – her keder vi os sjældent. Du bliver en del af et komplekst forretningsområde og kommer både til at arbejde med PaaS, COBOL, Angular, REST og Java.

”Du vil hurtigt få ansvar og opleve en stejl læringskurve her i Kapitalmarked Basis. Her udvikler og vedligeholder vi nemlig grundstammen af IT-systemer for nogle af Danmarks største pengeinstitutter – så du bliver en del af lidt af et brændpunkt, men på den fede måde, fordi andre er afhængige af dig og din ekspertise,” fortæller Helene Samuelsen, som er afdelingsleder for Depot.

Få indblik i komplekse udviklingsopgaver
Som software developer i Kapitalmarkedsområdet bliver du en del af Bankdatas Custody team. Et stærkt team med et stort engagement, hvor du vil komme til at samarbejde med erfarne og dygtige kolleger.
Vi er et velfungerende hold med stort fokus på arbejdsglæde, sparring og holdånd – vi hjælper hinanden og holder sammen i tykt og tyndt.
”Du kan forvente at få frie tøjler inden for de rammer, der er, og fuld opbakning til de valg, du træffer. Jeg forventer, at alle laver fejl – og lærer af dem,” udtaler afdelingsleder Helene Samuelsen.
Teamet er et ud af 12 teams på kapitalmarkedsområdet som udgør fundamentet af IT-systemer vedr. handel og administration af aktier og obligationer for nogle af Danmarks største pengeinstitutter. Teamet har base i Fredericia, hvor du også vil få arbejdssted.

Vi arbejder blandt andet med udvikling af Backend, Frontend, API’er, PaaS og Microservices og vi benytter eksempelvis følgende teknologier Cobol, Java, Angular, Rest og Jenkins hvortil et godt kendskab vil være en klar fordel.

Vores løsninger er komplekse, og det indebærer fokus på software af høj kvalitet. Vores produkt er centralt i pengeinstitutternes strategi, og derfor er leverancer til tiden og faglig sparring på et højt niveau en forudsætning.

Opgaverne vil blandt andet omfatte nyudvikling af IT-løsninger, afklaring af forretningens behov og udfordringer, test og efterfølgende support af systemer.

Aktiv medspiller med stort drive
Vi arbejder agilt ud fra metoden Scrum og du vil indgå i et Scrum team på 8 kolleger. I tæt samarbejde med Product owner, Scrum master og de andre team members vil I levere værdifulde løsninger til pengeinstitutterne.
For os er dine sociale færdigheder lige så vigtige som dine faglige kompetencer. Som person er du selvstændig, engageret med et stort drive, og kan håndtere både ansvar og frie arbejdsrammer. Du har et godt humør og gode samarbejdsevner, så du kan fungere som en aktiv medspiller i teamet og i dialog med pengeinstitutterne.

Forretningsforståelse og Java-erfaring
Vi leder efter en kollega, der har en kombination af forretningsindsigt og Java-udviklingskompetencer. Du behøver ikke have lige godt kendskab til begge felter, for vi sørger for de nødvendige kurser og oplæring.
Du har minimum et par års erfaring med java-programmering, med baggrund i enten en relevant it-uddannelse, eller solid erfaring med Java-programmering.
Du har erfaring med Git, ApiGee, Postman, Angular og Rest eller lignende værktøjer.
Et analytisk mindset og formår at nedbryde problemstillinger til håndterbare størrelser.
Du kan drive opgaver og vidensdele dem med teamet, ligesom du er villig til at undervise andre.
Det er en fordel du besidder viden om kapitalmarkedet men ikke et krav, du skal dog have lyst til at tilegne dig den viden.
Da vi arbejder med Scrum er det vigtigt du er proces orienteret i løsningen af opgaver og vil lære af den. 

Vil du vide mere?
Har du spørgsmål til jobbet, er du velkommen til at kontakte afdelingsleder Helene Samuelsen på 28 30 91 79 / hlk@bankdata.dk
Du søger stillingen ved at sende din ansøgning og dit CV via linket her på siden. Vi inviterer løbende kandidater til samtale, så send din ansøgning hurtigst muligt. Vi forventer at holde samtaler løbende.

Vi glæder os til at høre fra dig.
Bankdata er ejet af 8 pengeinstitutter og er med sine godt 800 ansatte en af landets største IT-arbejdspladser. Vi tilbyder stor frihed i jobbet, personlige udviklingsmuligheder, en række personalemæssige goder og en løn, der matcher jobbet. Analyser viser, at vi har nogle af landets mest tilfredse medarbejdere, og du kan læse meget mere om, hvad nogle af dem siger om at arbejde hos Bankdata.

But, there’s also so much more, such as flexible working, autonomy, continuous learning, meaningful work, future planning (family health and retirement) and other bits & bobs (i.e. socials and food).

342,New to the field • Software Engineer,Lunar,"Aarhus, Middle Jutland, Denmark",Actively recruiting,"Do you want to start your career in a place where you can help build a bank from scratch and learn from the best - wild, right? Do your eyes sparkle when we tell you that you can become a part of a hyper growth journey that requires the ability to learn fast and immerse yourself into the newest technologies? Can you see yourself as the backend competence in a squad, where you have to help set new standards for how to make and use financial products?
Is your head tired of nodding up and down? 

Then you should become our new Software Engineer. 

Glimpse into our tech 
Our technical platform is based on an event-based microservice architecture, where continuous and independent deployability is a must. We are pushing around 1000 releases a month to our users. We host our infrastructure in AWS and orchestrate our microservices via Kubernetes - and everything else that goes hand in hand with cloud native technologies. Our primary language is Go, but we also believe in ""the right tool for the job"". 

How we work 
At Lunar we do things simultaneously and at a fast pace - and to be able to do so, our engineering culture has to be based on an agile mindset. We are organised within squads that are divided into different sub-domains, making it possible for each squad to be on their own mission - and thereby enabling us to work autonomously. At Lunar, we pursue a culture that enables people to “think differently” and take ownership in their work-life here. At Lunar, responsibility is not something you get - it is something you take. 

Your pitch 
You may not be able to fill two A4 pages with your experience. However, you have the drive and desire to work with software in an organization where only you set the limits yourself. At the same time, you are not afraid to roll up your sleeves and give it your all. You want to learn and be part of a team where your goal is to deliver world-class experiences to our users.
Your ambitions are high, and you love to be challenged in your day-to-day life, both by skilled colleagues and exciting issues that need an ingenious solution. You want to help build robust software, where you need to focus just as much on error handling as sunshine scenarios. Your interests and competencies are within backend development, and you want to be in an organization where you have the opportunity to develop these even further.

You should definitely apply if you:
Wish to help us to scale our solutions, architecture, and design so that we can keep up with the growth in the number of users.
Want to be a key person in a strategically important team, where you help create the products that help realize our ambition of becoming the new bank of the Nordics.  
Would like to be part of a flat organization where you get the chance to contribute from day one.
Can see yourself contributing in creating innovative solutions, which set and enable new standards for user experience and satisfaction when it comes to financial products. 

Your skills & interests 
At Lunar, nothing is typical. Yet we have an idea of what a “typical” candidate in this position might look like. If you can check several things off the list - that would be great!
You have a relevant degree in Computer Science or Engineering, etc.
You have knowledge and perhaps some experience with; Go, .NET or JAVA. 
You are curious about microservice architecture, messaging, Docker, Kubernetes and would like to learn more. 
You might have some knowledge of; event sourcing, Grafana, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, design and develop secure systems.
 What’s in it for you?
You’ll make your mark on the new digital bank in the Nordics, and your daily work-life will be in our awesome office in the middle of Aarhus (Dokk1 is our neighbor) 
You’ll try a bunch of different things, with more new stuff to come.
Get great sparring with brilliant colleagues and the possibility to grow.
Casual tone, lots of laughs, and room for diversity. 
You’ll be a part of an entrepreneurial company full of drive and with great team spirit. Together we’ve already accomplished wonderful results, and we’re nowhere near done. 
At Lunar, we emphasize follow-up on the things we do, so we’re always learning - both as individuals and as a team.
We love diversity and all that sets us apart - that's what makes us awesome. Some are extroverted - some introverted. We don't all speak Danish, Norwegian or Swedish, but we all speak English. The most important thing is respect and understanding between one and another.

Does it sound like something right up your alley?
Then don't hesitate to apply and maybe you will become our new colleague. 
Feel free to reach out to our Recruitment Specialist, Louise Bjerregaard Andersen if you have any questions - her email is Lan@lunar.app. 
Together with your CV, we would also like to get your diploma, and if you have a Github profile - don't hesitate to share it with us!
Can't wait to read your application! 🚀

Vil du skabe værdi fra dag 1, når du deler din viden om værktøjer, som dine kolleger higer efter at lære mere om?

Vi skal til at implementere Java, microservice-arkitektur og de nyeste udviklingsmetoder og har brug for dig til at sikre, at vi får det optimale ud af både de nye værktøjer og vores eksisterende mainframe.
”Du bliver en central drivkraft i den omstilling, vi er i gang med. Både når du hjælper os med at vælge, hvilken vej vi skal gå, og når du lærer os, hvordan vi bruger de nye værktøjer bedst,” fortæller afdelingsleder for Fonds Boye Nielsen.

Vi er dem, der samarbejder bedst i Bankdata
Du bliver det 8. medlem af Trade Teamet, hvor vi har ansvaret for det it-setup, der bruges til international aktie- og obligationshandel. Det er et kompliceret område med 25 integrationer til forskellige handelssystemer, og fordi det er så komplekst, har vi brug for hinanden.
Til vores seneste medarbejderundersøgelse var vi det team, der var mest tilfredse med vores interne samarbejde. Og det er vi, fordi vi støtter og giver plads til hinanden og fordeler opgaverne imellem os, så alle synes, at det er sjovt og udfordrende at gå på arbejde.

Bliv Java-eksperten, der bringer os ind i fremtiden
På teamets rejse ind i den nye verden bliver du den, der ved mest om de nye udviklingsmetoder, og dermed den, de andre kommer til at spørge til råds, selvom du er den nyeste på holdet. Vi har guilds på tværs af hele Bankdata, hvor du altid kan hente hjælp, så du har rig mulighed for at udvikle dig fagligt.

Samtidig sætter du dig ind i vores legacy-kode, som er skrevet i COBOL, så du kan give dit besyv med, når vi sammen finder ud af, hvordan vi kombinerer det bedste fra begge verdener.
Du arbejder både med de nye værktøjer og den eksisterende mainframe, når du i Scrum-teamet videreudvikler og supporterer vores systemer, så de lever op til kravene fra kunderne og udviklingen i sektoren. Du bruger ca. 75 % af din tid på udvikling og ca. 25 % på support.

Du åbner gladeligt værktøjskassen, så andre kan kigge med
Du deler din viden med andre med største selvfølgelighed og elsker at være den, der bliver spurgt til råds. Det betyder også, at du gerne fortæller tingene 2 gange og er god til at lære fra dig. Samtidig ser du dig selv i en konstant udvikling i jagten på nye færdigheder. Og så kan du se dig selv trives i et miljø, hvor softwareudvikling er en holdindsats.

Derudover kommer du med en:
uddannelse som softwareudvikler enten fra et universitet eller en professionshøjskole – hovedsagen er, at du er rigtig skarp i Java-programmering
kvalitetsbevidst tilgang til arbejdet
solid indsigt i GIT, Angular, REST og continuous delivery – enten fra at have arbejdet med det i nogle år, eller fordi du har nørdet igennem på hjemmeserveren
interesse i at gå bagom kulisserne på kapitalmarkedet, men du behøver ikke at have brancheerfaring.

Given the growth that Efficio is going through, we are looking for Business Analysts (BAs) to provide support to project teams working on consulting assignments.

Business Analysts roles are targeted at graduate entry level candidates and are the first step into management consulting.

They must be able to work independently, while also being team players who are willing to contribute wherever needed to ensure the success of the project. The ability to prioritise their work effectively in the face of sometimes competing demands is also essential.

BAs are expected to challenge existing ways of doing things and suggest new ideas. However, they are also expected to be able to justify their conclusions and recommendations with relevant experience and rigorous, fact-based analysis.

Efficio has a collaborative, supportive culture where performance is recognised and success is celebrated. BAs are supported to continually develop their skills and expertise through a comprehensive training and development programme including formal training (through the Efficio Academy), on-the-job training, and coaching and mentoring from experienced consultants and Efficio executives. The opportunities and support that come from a role as an Efficio BA make it an unmatched springboard into a top-tier consulting career.Essential Requirements

At Lunar, we work in squads. A squad consists of cross-disciplinary members who make up all the skills needed to complete the mission: developers, line-of-business, QA or subject matter experts. Squad members are handpicked throughout all departments in the company to ensure we achieve our missions.

The squad is fully self-driven and takes complete responsibility for what they create. Each squad has a mission and will stop at nothing to complete it. To do that they have the full empowerment and freedom to execute in any way they wish. It is in the squads the magic happens.

Currently, we have four squads in Copenhagen, each of them with a unique and important mission:
Voyager: Without Voyager, Lunar can not support customers.
Surveyor: Without Surveyor, Lunar can not use the power of advanced tech to fight financial crime.
Pioneer: Without Pioneer, Lunar can not scale with reason.
Rosetta: Without Rosetta, Lunar can not run a banking operation.
And this is just the beginning....

A look under the hood - our tech

We have built our internal technology platform on an event-based microservice architecture and have about 250 of them running. Continuous and independent deployability is crucial, as we release about 1000 times to production a month. We aim to be multi-cloud, but with most of our services running in Kubernetes on AWS. We love GoLang but honestly believe in using the right tool for the job: Python, JavaScript, or whatever else gets the job done.

At Lunar, we build the rocket ship while we race to the moon and beyond. To do that, we simultaneously expand our offerings and features while we maintain a solid, optimised and scalable platform for our more than 250.000 customers. It requires steady nerves and a super steady focus doing that.

Your elevator-pitch

You have the drive and ambition to develop software, where only you and your squad set the limits. You have a unique set of technical skills to add to the already impressive brainpower we have at Lunar. You are prepared to challenge the norms and know that the best argument is vital. You are a team player and not necessarily the rockstar that craves the lime-light but also enjoys being one of the unsung heroes backstage. Your focus is on backend development and maybe you have a passion for data and its usage. You have experience that you want to utilize at Lunar, but you also love to learn and grow.

So, what do we need?

About

Even though there is absolutely nothing typical about Lunar, we still have a pretty good idea of what a ""typical"" backender looks like
You have at least three years of experience from a role similar to what we are looking for - not necessarily from the same industry.
You have an education within Computer Science, Engineering or Data Science, or experience from ""the School of Life"" that is equal.
It is a must that you have experience with some part of the tech stack. That being Go programming, RabbitMQ, Event Sourcing, Grafana, Data engineering, GraphQL, Microservice architecture, or any other aspects that will ensure that the squad can complete the mission from a technical point of view.
You don't look away when somebody needs help, but you know when to interfere and when not to.
You don't take yourself too seriously and have an open mind.
What's in it for you?
You will have the unique opportunity to be part of building up not only the new bank of the Nordics but also the brand new Tech-hub from our excellent offices in central Copenhagen.
You will be part of a bunch of intelligent techies and ambitious financial nerds from whom you will learn from and grow every day.
You will be part of an informal organisation, where it is not the ironing of your shirt or your title that gives you the mandate to have an opinion but your arguments and passion for continually improving.
You will become part of a company that wants to make sure that you are well mentally and physically. This means that Yoga and meditation are encouraged throughout work hours, and if that is not your thing, we have padel tournaments, board games, cycling clubs and much more that you can take part in.
We love diversity and everything that makes us different from everybody else because that makes us extraordinary. We come from all kinds of backgrounds, and speak all kinds of languages, so English is our business language. Our most important value is respect and understanding because only with that mindset can we move forward with supersonic speed.

Are you ready to be part of the journey?

If you want to be part of Lunar, a place where passion and opinions matter, and we strive for nothing less than awesomeness, then get in touch with us, and become part of one of our fantastic squads.

The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a new capability in Windows that opens up new possibilities for Linux development and operations in Windows environments. WSL is not a virtual machine system like Hyper-V, nor an operations capability like Docker or Kubernetes, nor a cloud simulator like Multipass. Instead, WSL offers a specific set of capabilities from a Linux environment across to the Windows desktop, allowing for interesting new kinds of integration to take place at that boundary. Use your Windows editors and version control, compile and test on Linux, for example.

We are excited to explore the forefront of these possibilities, helping to shape the future of Windows-and-Linux development. We work closely with the WSL team to ensure that the latest capabilities in WSL are usable and well integrated with Ubuntu. We work with other developer communities, such as those at Nvidia, to ensure that the cross-over of their needs and the Windows platform takes advantage of WSL.

Så har du nu en fed mulighed hos Bankdata for at arbejde med de nyeste teknologier og være med til at påvirke hele vores organisation på rejsen mod en mere moderne infrastruktur.

Læg jernbanesvellerne for vores andre teams

Som vores nye udvikler får du massiv betydning for mange af vores andre teams, da du kommer til at arbejde med vores platforme og infrastruktur. På den korte bane bliver det dit ansvar at videreudvikle på vores nuværende MS SQL-platform og tage de første skridt mod DevOps og cloud (Azure).

Du kommer til at få et bredt og tæt netværk til mange af vores teams, som både vil bidrage i udviklingen, men som du også vil skulle motivere til og instruere i at bruge nye systemer og teknologier.

Konkret Skal Du Bl.a.
fastholde viden i dokumentation og udarbejde og opdatere dokumentation på infrastruktur, processer for udvikling, deployment m.m.
deltage i dialoger med teams og arkitekter for at få konkret viden fra dagligdagen ude i teams og binde det sammen med arkitekturstrategier til konkrete implementeringsplaner
udvikle mindre og større dataapplikationer i samspil med teams
lære vores MS SQL-server-implementering at kende inkl. miljøer, dataflows, udviklingsprocesser etc.

378,"Software Engineer • Backend (CPH) Software Engineering & Development · Copenhagen, Denmark",Lunar,"København, Capital Region, Denmark",Actively recruiting,"Do you have what it takes to be part of building the new bank of the Nordics? Do you have the brains, guts and team spirit to take Lunar to the next level? Are you ready to be a Backend Engineer in one of our first squads in Copenhagen while working with our tech superstars from Aarhus as well?

If so, then let us know you are up to the challenge by applying now ??

Squad, What? - our organisation

At Lunar, we work in squads. A squad consists of cross-disciplinary members who make up all the skills needed to complete the mission: developers, line-of-business, QA or subject matter experts. Squad members are handpicked throughout all departments in the company to ensure we achieve our missions.

The squad is fully self-driven and takes complete responsibility for what they create. Each squad has a mission and will stop at nothing to complete it. To do that they have the full empowerment and freedom to execute in any way they wish. It is in the squads the magic happens.

Currently, we have four squads in Copenhagen, each of them with a unique and important mission:
Voyager: Without Voyager, Lunar can not support customers.
Surveyor: Without Surveyor, Lunar can not use the power of advanced tech to fight financial crime.
Pioneer: Without Pioneer, Lunar can not scale with reason.
Rosetta: Without Rosetta, Lunar can not run a banking operation.
And this is just the beginning....

A look under the hood - our tech

We have built our internal technology platform on an event-based microservice architecture and have about 250 of them running. Continuous and independent deployability is crucial, as we release about 1000 times to production a month. We aim to be multi-cloud, but with most of our services running in Kubernetes on AWS. We love GoLang but honestly believe in using the right tool for the job: Python, JavaScript, or whatever else gets the job done.

At Lunar, we build the rocket ship while we race to the moon and beyond. To do that, we simultaneously expand our offerings and features while we maintain a solid, optimised and scalable platform for our more than 250.000 customers. It requires steady nerves and a super steady focus doing that.

Your elevator-pitch

You have the drive and ambition to develop software, where only you and your squad set the limits. You have a unique set of technical skills to add to the already impressive brainpower we have at Lunar. You are prepared to challenge the norms and know that the best argument is vital. You are a team player and not necessarily the rockstar that craves the lime-light but also enjoys being one of the unsung heroes backstage. Your focus is on backend development and maybe you have a passion for data and its usage. You have experience that you want to utilize at Lunar, but you also love to learn and grow.

So, what do we need?

About

Even though there is absolutely nothing typical about Lunar, we still have a pretty good idea of what a ""typical"" backender looks like
You have at least three years of experience from a role similar to what we are looking for - not necessarily from the same industry.
You have an education within Computer Science, Engineering or Data Science, or experience from ""the School of Life"" that is equal.
It is a must that you have experience with some part of the tech stack. That being Go programming, RabbitMQ, Event Sourcing, Grafana, Data engineering, GraphQL, Microservice architecture, or any other aspects that will ensure that the squad can complete the mission from a technical point of view.
You don't look away when somebody needs help, but you know when to interfere and when not to.
You don't take yourself too seriously and have an open mind.
What's in it for you?
You will have the unique opportunity to be part of building up not only the new bank of the Nordics but also the brand new Tech-hub from our excellent offices in central Copenhagen.
You will be part of a bunch of intelligent techies and ambitious financial nerds from whom you will learn from and grow every day.
You will be part of an informal organisation, where it is not the ironing of your shirt or your title that gives you the mandate to have an opinion but your arguments and passion for continually improving.
You will become part of a company that wants to make sure that you are well mentally and physically. This means that Yoga and meditation are encouraged throughout work hours, and if that is not your thing, we have padel tournaments, board games, cycling clubs and much more that you can take part in.
We love diversity and everything that makes us different from everybody else because that makes us extraordinary. We come from all kinds of backgrounds, and speak all kinds of languages, so English is our business language. Our most important value is respect and understanding because only with that mindset can we move forward with supersonic speed.

Are you ready to be part of the journey?

If you want to be part of Lunar, a place where passion and opinions matter, and we strive for nothing less than awesomeness, then get in touch with us, and become part of one of our fantastic squads.

381,Software Developer med interesse for domænearkitektur,Bankdata,"Fredericia, South Denmark, Denmark",Actively recruiting,"Trives du i en hverdag, hvor du både får lov til at forme afdelingens fremtid og samtidig har hænderne nede i den praktiske surdej? Har du erfaring som Software Developer, og har du lyst til at arbejde tænke software udvikling i et bredere perspektiv

Så er du måske vores nye domænearkitekt indenfor kapitalmarkedet i Bankdata, der dækker 12 teams og ca. 70 medarbejdere. Lige nu står vi over for at skulle se på, hvordan it i vores virksomhed ser ud om 5, 10 og 20 år. Og vi har brug for din hjælp.

Balance mellem fremadskuende og hands-on opgaver

Som vores nye domænearkitekt indenfor kapitalmarkedet kommer du til at arbejde med 3 overordnede områder, som har en nogenlunde ligelig fordeling rent arbejdsmæssigt.
Fremadskuende, strategiske projekter. Her får du sammen med dine 2 tætteste kollegaer, som også er domænearkitekter, muligheden for at gå et skridt foran og sætte dit præg på, hvordan it-udviklingen i afdelingen skal se ud fremadrettet – fx de næste 5 år.
Strategisk arkitekturarbejde. På tværs af teams understøtter du de nuværende strategiske projekter og sikrer, at de arkitekturmæssigt hænger sammen.
Center of Excellence. Du bidrager på adhoc-basis dine kolleger, fx ved at kigge på deres gamle it-systemer m.m. Som Center of Excellence har vi samlet vores ekspertise ét sted.
Spændende teknologi

På teknologi-siden arbejder vi bl.a. med udstilling af APIer i en REST-baseret microservice arkitektur, specificeret igennem OpenAPI v3 / YAML , og som enten er implementeret i et containerized miljø med Java/Spring Boot som underliggende stack eller igennem udstilling af service-kald på vores z/OS Mainframe, og her er du som domænearkitekt med til at sikre, at vi udstiller det rette rigtigt.”

Gode udviklingsmuligheder internt i Bankdata

Med dine mange touch points i virksomheden og den brede kontaktflade både socialt og forretningsmæssigt er der gode muligheder for udvikling internt i Bankdata. Vi fokuserer meget på vores arbejdsmiljø, og vi er stolte af, at Bankdata er så godt et sted at være, så medarbejdere ofte rykker rundt i virksomheden i stedet for at søge væk.

Trygt team, der ynder at tale tingene godt igennem

I det helt nære team er der 2 andre domænearkitekter, som bliver dine tætteste kollegaer. Vi arbejder fantastisk godt sammen, og vi sætter en ære i at skabe tryghed i teamet, så vi aldrig er bange for at være uenige og diskutere internt. Problemløsning på et højt fagligt niveau er en af vores spidskompetencer, og vi adskiller altid vores faglige uenigheder fra den personlige snak ved kaffeautomaten.

Fysisk sidder vi i Fredericia, hvor vi prioriterer at være samlet hoveddelen af tiden, mens der samtidig er fine muligheder for fleksibilitet.

Nysgerrig, empatisk og med evnen til både at være ”på” alene og samarbejde

Som person er du nysgerrig og opsøgende, og mens du er knalddygtig til samarbejde, viger du ikke tilbage fra at kaste dig ud i ting selv. Med en god portion empati og faglig ballast formår du at præsentere forandringer og baggrunden for disse, så selv de mest skeptiske bliver overvundet.

Din Vedholdende Person Og Din Analytiske Og Metodiske Tilgang Til Projekter Er Vigtigere, End Hvad Du Har Lavet Før, Men Vi Forestiller Os, At Du Kan Sætte Kryds Ved Noget Af Følgende

Du behøver ikke have erfaring som domænearkitekt, den viden får du opbygget i samarbejde med de to øvrige domænearkitekter. Men vi forventer du har lyst til at arbejde med software udvikling på et højere plan, samt har interesse for hvad der sker indenfor software udvikling i omverdenen. Du skal desuden kunne trives i, at dit arbejde ofte først har pay-off på den lange bane.
Interesse for at arbejde med domænemodellering/Domain Driven Design
Erfaring med at drive projekter/initiativer
Uddannelse som fx cand. IT. eller lign.

Then look no further, as this might be exactly the challenge you´re looking for. We offer you the chance to be a part of a truly international and vibrant company with more than 280 skilled and dedicated employees worldwide, who are all passionate about creating next-generation mission-critical financial services infrastructure and leading the rise of a super-correspondent banking network.

The position and why we need you

At Banking Circle we want to make an impact that pioneers the industry and creates instant value for our clients.

To support both that and our exciting growth journey we are looking to hire a talented Data Engineer, who is eager to participate in building the next generation of our data platform, on the Azure cloud.

The data engineering team owns our existing data platform, which is closely coupled to our legacy payment processing system. As the whole system landscape is being replaced with state-of-the-art services, more and more data sources is coming online and will increase the need for a new decoupled and near real time data platform across all data assets. This is the data platform that we are building to support Banking Circles ability to enter the next level. Your tech stack will include Python, Azure functions, Databricks, Delta Lake on Azure Data Lake storage, Azure SQL (synapse), Tableau (PowerBI) and Terraform for infrastructure as code, but the stack will continuously evolve.

Contribute to continuous improvement of the team´s ways of working
Take responsibility for own learning and development

If you have experience with PowerBI or Terraform it would be an advantage, otherwise you can pick it up in the process. You have an educational background within computer science, engineering or similar field (BSc level as a minimum). We furthermore expect you to be a dependable and knowledge-sharing team-player that cooperates well at all levels of an organization. As Banking Circle is an international company, it is a requirement, that you are fluent in English, both verbally and in writing. The position will be based at Banking Circles office in Copenhagen.

Job

Vi arbejder agilt i teamet, og derfor skal du aktivt være med til at bryde arbejdsopgaverne ned og byde ind på opgaverne. Teamet består af .NET-udviklere, hvilket er det primære framework, vi benytter. Du sparrer løbende med product owner og er som senior softwareudvikler med til at sikre, at løsningerne passer til infrastrukturen, og en arkitektur, der er vedligeholdbar og testbar for teamet.

Du Vil i Løbet Af Arbejdsdagen Blandt Andet

Vi vil rigtig gerne holde på vores dygtigste medarbejdere. Det gør vi bedst, når vi giver vores medarbejdere mulighed for at udvikle deres kompetencer og prøve nye udfordringer.

” Vi går meget op i at kunne tilbyde vores kunder de bedste produkter. Derfor vægter vi også læring og uddannelse enormt højt i den her afdeling, så vi hele tiden er i stand til at gøre tingene lidt bedre for vores kunder. Det er essentielt for vores succes, at vi ikke kun udvikler produkterne, men også vores egne kompetencer og teknologier, ” fortæller afdelingsleder André Valgren Steensen.

I Bankdata samarbejder vi med LinkedIn Learning, og vi sender gerne vores medarbejdere til alskens kurser og akkrediteringer. Når du får tiden og ressourcerne til at blive dygtigere, så er det ikke kun til gavn for dig, men for hele virksomheden. Du har også mulighed for at udvikle dig i retning af enten domænearkitekt eller lead softwareudvikler, hvor man skaber forandringer på tværs af hele Bankdata.

Krav

Vi forventer, at du er med til at sætte retning i teamet gennem dit overblik og drive, så vi er konkurrencedygtige på området Personal Finance Management, og så vores banker har den mobil- og netbank, der gør en forskel for kundens digitale relation.

Vores arbejde er komplekst og kræver et højt fagligt niveau. Vi forestiller os derfor, at du:
har en kandidatgrad som datalog, softwareingeniør eller lignende
har arbejdet 3-5 år med .NET og C# og har god forståelse for REST services og domain-driven design
taler og skriver flydende dansk og engelsk
muligvis har erfaring fra en enterprisefunktion i en finansiel virksomhed, der gør dig i stand til at forstå vores kunders forretningsbehov og udfordre den gode løsning (det er et plus, men ikke et krav, da vi naturligvis lærer dig op i domænet).

398,Data Engineer,Lunar,"København, Capital Region, Denmark",2 weeks ago,"Do you want to be part of building the foundation for one of our new squads, Rosetta? Can you see yourself working to help our banking and financial operations team execute and maintain the ever-growing amount of economic data flowing through our bank? Rosetta needs to operate in our banking systems’ deepest cores and foundations and extract information from a spectrum of external systems.

Are you up for the challenge? Send us your application now.

A look under the hood - our tech

We have built our internal technology platform on an event-based microservice architecture and have about 250 of them running. Continuous and independent deployability is crucial, as we release about 1000 times to production a month. We aim to be multi-cloud, but with most of our services running in Kubernetes on AWS. We love GoLang but honestly believe in using the right tool for the job: Python, JavaScript, or whatever else gets the job done.

At Lunar, we build the rocket ship while we race to the moon and beyond. To do that, we simultaneously expand our offerings and features while we maintain a solid, optimised and scalable platform for our more than 250.000 customers. It requires steady nerves and a super steady focus doing that.

Your elevator-pitch

Rosetta is all about data, and you love that. You don't necessarily get your highs from building next level predictive models, but more from enabling a rock-solid data foundation of financial and customer data. You know and appreciate the importance of having impeccable quality data, and your friends are sick and tired of you using the phrase ""Garbage in, Garbage out"" all the time.

You want to work in an environment where you and your squad are the ones that set the limits, and you want to aim for the moon. You are open-minded and a team player at your very core. So you, of course, want to be part of a diverse team that consists of the right people from all over the business handpicked to complete the mission.

You have experience working with data, and you have a good idea of how to get your hands on it, align it and expose it to both internal and external consumers.

Finally, you dig financial data and understand the basic needs of balancing and possibly report on it.

The role & tasks

At Lunar, we work in squads, each on a specific mission. A squad consists of cross-disciplinary members that make up all the skills needed to complete the mission, that being developers, line-of-business, QA or plain old subject matter experts. You will be part of squad Rosetta and work out of our Tech-hub in Copenhagen, the newest spawn in our tech community. Tech-hub CPH is so fresh that we expect you to be part of forming a unique style and culture and assist it in growing the hub.

The Job Includes Tasks Like

As a Data Engineer in Rosetta, your primary task will be to ensure the collection, validation, refinement and exposure of data for our core banking operations and our financial team.
Collect, and validate event data from relevant internal services.
Build integrations with external data sources for ingestion and transformation.
Ensure quantitative and qualitative validation of data.
Transform and expose data to consumers that being as flat files, databases or API's
The Tech

Rosetta's tech stack focuses on the possibility of working with, getting and making data available to data consumers. To ensure this, Rosetta is the primary consumers, builders and maintainers of the financial data platform 'Enterprise'. Enterprise is planned to be built on an Apache Airflow foundation. It uses S3 buckets and possible Redshift as data storage... unless you can bring forward the arguments for a better stack.

All About You
You have at least two years of experience working with data engineering, or the likes of it.
You either have an education in Computer Science, Engineering or Data Science, or experience from ""the School of Life"" that is equal.
Experience with some part of the tech stack is a must. That being Python programming, RabbitMQ, Data QA, ETL work, Cloud architecture, or other aspects that will ensure that we can complete the mission from a tech point of view.
You do not necessarily have any experience working with financial and banking data, but you have the discipline to ensure that the data is under the strictest governance.
What's in it for you?
You will have the unique opportunity to be part of building up not only the new bank of the Nordics but also the brand new Tech-hub from our excellent offices in central Copenhagen.
You will be part of a bunch of pretty intelligent techies and ambitious financial nerds from whom you will learn from and grow every day.
You will be part of an informal organisation, where it is not the ironing of your shirt or your title that gives you the mandate to have an opinion but your arguments and passion for continually improving.
You will become part of a company that wants to make sure that you are well mentally and physically. This means that Yoga and meditation are encouraged throughout work hours, and if that is not your thing, we have padel tournaments, board games, cycling clubs and much more that you can take part in.
We love diversity and everything that makes us different from everybody else because that makes us extraordinary. We come from all kinds of backgrounds, and speak all kinds of languages, so English is our business language. Our most important value is respect and understanding because only with that mindset can we move forward with supersonic speed.

Are you ready to be part of the journey?

If you want to be part of Lunar, a place where passion and opinions matter, and we strive for nothing less than awesomeness, then get in touch with us, and become part of Squad Rosetta.

If you have any questions regarding the position, please contact Bank Development Manager Anne Carøe Hald at click apply or Head of Technology, Banking Operations, Anders Kring at click apply, and they will try to answer your questions.

Nu mangler vi en Junior Business Analyst, hvis vigtigste opgave er at skabe gennemsigtighed for hvordan vi fortsat for- bedrer vores kunders resultater med Scalepoints løsninger. Du skaber gennemsigtighed ved at kombinere dine analyti- ske evner til at omsætte data til viden, og kommercielle evner til at kommunikere din viden skarpt til kunder og kollegaer. Med denne analytiske og kommercielle tilgang bidrager du til at gøre samarbejdet med vores kunder endnu stærkere. Vi har brug for dig på holder nu, fordi vores stigende antal kunder efterspørger mere hjælp fra talenter som dig. Hvilken nørd er du? Hos Scalepoint møder du en flok dedikerede nørder, der – lige som dig – elsker at gå på arbejde. Og vi glæder os til at ar- bejde sammen med dig, hvis du har talent for: Analytisk problemløsning: Du hjælper vores kunder til at træffe datadrevne beslutninger, ved at skære gennem støjen og få vigtig viden frem i lyset. Struktureret kommunikation: Du kan forklare kompleks viden simpelt, og sikre forståelse for dine budskaber på forskel- lige niveauer af kundernes organisation. Proaktiv holdspiller: Det er naturligt for dig at opsøge muligheder for at bruge din viden til at spille dig, dine kollegaer og kunder gode. Opgaver, du skal fordybe dig i Når en medarbejder får en god ide, er der luft til at udvikle den i Scalepoint. For det er vores grundholdning, at det kræ- ver ambitioner at erobre verden. Du ligger også inde med en solid portion ambitioner og gode idéer. Bliver du en del af holdet, skal du især fordybe dig i: Dataanalyse: Ved at gennemskue store datamængder kan du hjælpe med at besvare hvilke resultater kunden har op- nået, hvorfor de har opnået disse resultater, og hvordan vi kan hjælpe dem med at opnå endnu bedre resultater. Til denne opgave arbejder vi primært med Excel. Rapportering: Ved løbende at tage temperaturen på vores forretning, vil du fremhæve muligheder og udfordringer i ar- bejdet med vores kunder. Til denne opgave arbejder vi primært med PowerBI. Præsentationer: Ved at skabe klare visuelle fremstillinger sikrer du kunderne forstår dine budskaber og agerer på vores rådgivning. Til denne opgave arbejder vi primært med PowerPoint. Scalepoint Spirit i hverdagen I Scalepoint er der plads til at være den, du er. Dresscode og arbejdsformelle facader hører andre planeter til, og det samme gør faste konstellationer ved frokostbordet. Til gengæld er her masser af kram og high fives – og tillid til, at alle gør deres bedste. På vores kontor i København og vores satellitter i Polen og Schweiz arbejder mennesker med 11 nationaliteter. 63 pct. af os cykler på arbejde, 42 pct. spiser vegetarisk til frokost, 38 pct. er forældre, og 52 pct. dyrker ikke sport regelmæssigt. Det sidste prøver vores selverklærede sportsminister at ændre på med badminton- og løbeklub.

Rent formelt forestiller vi os, at du er ved at uddanne dig inden for økonomi, IT eller lignende. Det er en fordel, hvis du har et par år tilbage før du afslutter din uddannelse. Det er en for- del fordi vi kan sikre du bliver en succes i denne rolle, inden vi forsøger at gøre dig til stjerne i en fuldtidsrolle.

Kan du noget helt særligt inden for BI og datavisualisering? Har du erfaring med Microsoft Power BI, DAX, Power Platformen, Azure og SQL – og kunne du tænke dig arbejde med nogle af Danmarks største virksomheder? Så er det dig, vi søger!

Vi Har Kontor i København NV Og Aarhus Og Arbejder Med

VENZO Analytics søger ambitiøse Senior IT & Business Analysts til en hurtigt voksende BI og Analytics virksomhed.
Analytics og visualisering i Microsoft Power BI og Power Platformen
Data warehouse modernisering og migrering til Azure
BI migrering fra særligt Tableau, Qlick og TARGIT til Microsoft Power BI
IT Service Management (ITSM) og Financial Analytics
Demokratisering af data og BI self-service.
Se Her Et Par Korte Videoer Om, Hvordan Vi Arbejder Og Vores Samarbejde Med Kunder Og Partnere

Hertil har vi udviklet et koncept, der integrerer datavidenskab og psykologi ved datavisualisering med henblik på at styrke ledelsens evne til at træffe beslutninger og skabe forandringer i deres organisation.

Om dig og dine kvalifikationer

Du er motiveret af at visualisere data i æstetisk smukke dashboards, som er enkle (less is more), og som understøtter ledelsens behov for et hurtigt og effektivt overblik. Vi måler vores succes med dashboards/datavisualisering ved, at de bliver aktivt anvendt af kunderne – og skaber et reelt grundlag for beslutning og ændret adfærd. Derfor er det afgørende, at du kan identificere og forstå kundens behov for ”data storytelling” – dvs. sætte dig ind i de svar, som datavisualiseringen skal give og den ændrede adfærd, som det skal skabe for kunden.

Vi arbejder efter et princip, vi kalder ”10-60-600”. Det betyder, at et dashboard skal skabe overblik indenfor 10 sekunder, identificere afvigelser og handlemuligheder inden for 60 sekunder, og give mulighed for at ”drille ned” og udforske rådata og årsagsforklaringer indenfor 600 sekunder. Alt sammen med udgangspunkt i kunden behov og forretning. Du er motiveret for at forstå kundens behov og visualisere data, så de understøtter ”10-60-600” designprincippet og styrker kundens evne og mulighed for at træffe beslutninger og skabe ændret adfærd.

Du har erfaring med Microsoft Power, DAX, SQL – og forstår at bruge kildedata til at designe data warehouses (DWH fact dimensioner etc.). Du er Microsoft certificeret i en eller flere decilpiner.

Det er en fordel, hvis du har erfaring med migrering fra Qlick, Tableau eller TARGIT til Microsoft Power BI. Det er yderligere en fordel, hvis du har erfaring med at etablere skalérbar cloud infrastruktur til SaaS services – som eksempelvis VENZO Azure Cost Management Service . Se også af løsningen.

Din tilgang til problemløsning er pragmatisk og agil, og du er vant til skabe bro mellem forretning og rå datasæt. Du søger konstant at forenkle og simplificere og forstår vigtigheden af kundens deltagelse i den proces.

Du har bopæl i Danmark og kan fremvise en ren straffeattest.

Vi tilbyder en anderledes BI og Analytics arbejdsplads

VENZO Analytics er en ambitiøs virksomhed med drevne ambitiøse medarbejdere og plads til personlig og faglig udvikling. Vi har det princip, at ”din markedsværdi skal stige gennem dit arbejde, mens du fastholdes gennem trivsel og godt kollegaskab”. Derfor søger vi konstant udfordringer og uddannelse/certificeringer, som gør os selv og hinanden dygtigere. Vi måler os selv i kundernes positive tilbagemeldinger – og sætter en ære i, at vores løsninger gør en markant og mærkbar forskel for kunderne. Denne forskel kan være gennem reducerede omkostninger til cloud infrastruktur eller ved at skabe dashboards, som bliver anvendt til at tage beslutninger samt skabe ændret adfærd hos kunderne. Se disse kundevideoer på og som eksempler. Vi vil ganske enkelt se, høre, og mærke, at vores løsninger gør en forskel for kunderne.

Vi søger de absolut bedste – og de bedste i vores perspektiv er dygtige og ambitiøse kollegaer, som forstår at støtte og hjælpe hinanden til at lykkes i fællesskab. Vi er et hold, og vi passer på hinanden.

Vores omgivelser er uprætentiøse og afslappede. Påklædning varierer fra vandkæmmet hår og jakkesæt til T-shirts og kondisko. Det afgørende er ambitioner, kvalifikationer og evnen til at samarbejde og lykkes i fællesskab. Vi er meget forskellige, men forenet i at lykkes som et hold.

Om stillingen som Senior IT & Business Analyst og ”Trusted advisor”

Som Senior IT & Business Analyst vil du indgå som en vital del af vores Analytics team samt indgå aktivt i at understøtte leverancer på én eller flere forskellige kundeprojekter. Du vil indgå i et tæt samarbejde med forretningsressourcer både internt i VENZO og hos kunder.

Projekterne er forskellige og kan variere lige fra migrering og visualisering af et Excel-regneark til etablering af en global rapporteringsplatform. Hertil kommer migrering fra Qlick, Tableu og TARGIT til Microsoft Power BI. Den røde tråd er data warehouse modernisering, BI demokratisering/self-service og datavisualisering (som bygger på VENZOS 10-60-600 princip). Din rolle og fokus vil afhænge af din erfaring, kompetencer og interesser. I det omfang du motiveres af salg, vil du medvirke til pre-sales og tilbudsskrivning.

Vi arbejder typisk i teams bestående af en projektleder, Power BI specialist (datavisualisering) og backend specialist (data warehouse, Azure, SQL, SSAS). Ved større projekter bemandes med flere kollegaer, og opgaver/projekter løses selvstændigt/alene eller i mindre grupper. Uanset projektets størrelse, er samarbejde og adgang til kollegaernes input og sparring en afgørende faktor.

Du vil desuden indgå i rådgivning og vejledning af kunder – og medvirke til at udarbejde BI strategier og beslutningsoplæg til kundernes valg af fremtidig dataplatform. Du forstår således betydningen af rollen som ”Trusted Advisor” og evner at sætte dig ind i kundens behov og forretning, så du kan vejlede og rådgive optimalt.

Case og præsentation for ledelsen

I forbindelsen med rekrutteringsprocessen, vil du blive bedt om at løse en case. Casen omfatter et dataudtræk og en række spørgsmål, som skal løses i Power BI og præsenteres for ledelsen i VENZO Analytics.

Om VENZO

Som ansat i VENZO kan du se frem til et selvstændigt job med bred kontakt til såvel kunder som hele VENZO’s organisation. Kulturen er dynamisk med en uformel og direkte omgangstone – og du vil i høj grad få mulighed for at sætte dit eget præg på stillingen. Derudover lægger vi stor vægt på, at du løbende udvikler og styrker dine kompetencer, da det er afgørende for VENZO at fastholde et højt fagligt niveau blandt vores medarbejdere. Lønnen afspejler dine kompetencer.

447,Software Engineers striving for making an impact,Deloitte Consulting,"København, Capital Region, Denmark",1 week ago,"Deloitte drives progress. Deloitte offers global integrated professional services that include Audit & Assurance, Consulting, Financial Advisory, Risk Advisory and Tax Consulting. Our approach combines intellectual leadership, industrial expertise, insight, consulting and problem-solving capabilities whatever the role, technology revolutions and innovation from multiple disciplines to help our clients excel anywhere in the world. Deloitte invests in outstanding people of diverse talents and backgrounds and empowers them to achieve more than they could elsewhere. Our work combines advice with action and integrity. We believe that when our clients and society are stronger, so are we.

We, in the Systems Engineering department of Deloitte Consulting Denmark, are on the lookout for additional team-players to help us cope with rising client demand for our services.

The department consists of 60+ consultants (some of which works as developers) of varying experience levels. We assist our clients on the implementation of new systems as part of their digital transformation. Our clients are based in all industries with public, finance and transportation as current strongholds.

Exciting tasks await you!

To thrive in Deloitte, you embrace working with different aspects of development and varying tech-stacks. Our client assignments vary greatly, but still, most of the assignments can be put into one of the below three options. Common for all of them are, that we strive to work with the technologies that the client prefers. Often, you will have a specialty within one of the three, but the possibility to learn and grow within all of them.
Client assignments will often have you work on the following:
Application development on solutions of all sizes, often in Agile settings (SAFE/Scrum). Backend and frontend development towards public clouds or on-premise.
Enabling DevOps through development of CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code.
Test automation on different levels (unit, integration, UI, end-to-end, data).
Besides client work, consultants on all levels take part in internal tasks, such as sales activities and further development of our organisation. The distribution between them depends on your seniority, role and profile.
Sales activities includes:
Identify and act on new client needs on your current projects.
Join in on workshops/sales pitches as a domain specialist.
Contribute to proposals for new client projects.
Organisational development adds to our collective ability to perform well in the market. Could include:
Building internal capabilities through community tasks, maybe within new business areas.
Assist on developing internal tools to make us even better.
How do we work as developers in Deloitte?

We work side-by-side with our clients during all stages of their systems transformation, that being analysis of as-is, envisioning to-be states or implementing solutions. Technology-wise, the client assignments might bring us all the way from mainframes to serverless compute clouds and our tasks might be anything from pure advise to hands-on implementation, depending on the project and your profile. As a developer within Systems Engineering you will primarily be working on implementation of various systems, while you have the option to twist your career towards advising as your seniority grows.

Client projects are often longer commitments of 3-12 months, meaning you will get deep into the client and industry context. Typically, we assist clients in minor teams of 3-6 people, but sometimes we assist with bigger teams of cross-disciplinary skills.

We desire developers, who wish to become more than just a coding grunt. Coding is your craft and of course you are excellent at it. But you should have an appetite for more. An appetite for influencing the systems, you are contributing to, for the better. Be prepared to participate in analysis and advising as well as development. Together, we will accelerate your growth towards becoming a first class lead programmer or solution architect.

Deloitte is only as good as its people. For that reason, a number of initiatives are in place to empower you throughout your career development. Everyone is assigned a talent manager to support their career aspirations as well as hold frequent check-ins with senior coworkers on their client projects.

Also, there is a tech community with monthly meetings, where we share knowledge and investigate new topics, as well as upskill within relevant technologies and methodologies.

448,Juice programmer with a focus on UI,Triband,"København, Capital Region, Denmark",Your profile matches this job,"If you thrive collaborating with both designers and programmers to implement the juiciest interfaces, effects and game feel and by using C# and Unity skills to bring that extra life to the game.

Then come join the team behind WHAT THE GOLF? and play with us on our upcoming next big project.

What You Will Do

UI, juice, and game feel

As a Juice programmer with a focus on UI, you will be part of the team behind our unannounced new game. Your main responsibility will be building and maintaining consistent UI across the game. This is amongst other things: menus, speech bubbles, localized texts, but also juicy pop-ups and of course lots of gameplay effects and particles.

This happens in close collaboration with a UX designer, 2D artist, and basically, everyone else as UI is touching all parts of the game.
Implement a cohesive UI experience through the game
Implement game feel related juice and effects in gameplay
Collaborate on UX design in Figma (our UI mockup tool of choice)
Work closely with designers and programmers on how to make everything fit together
Explore ideas and come up with new smart things we hadn't yet thought of
WHAT YOU WILL ALSO DO: Help out and explore your own ideas

Everyone has a main responsibility (this), but we also make time to explore other things. Maybe you are interested in playing with that new physics feature or try making that wacky level idea you came up with.

We encourage people to learn new things and just help each other out across projects and teams.

Requirements
You prioritize the user experience and how things feel, not just how they work
Proficiency in C# and programming in Unity
You've worked with Unity UI canvas or equivalent UI frameworks
3+ years of experience and having shipped games in larger teams
Requirements

For Any Job Opening At Triband
You thrive taking ownership of your own area. You can spot problems, ask for advice when in doubt, and implement your own solution
You actively support a culture of collaboration, mutual respect, inclusiveness, and creativity
A great working environment is important for you and you help out around you
Team production experience, such as using git, branching, stand-ups, sprints, reviews
Practicalities
37 hours work week with options for flexible schedules
No crunch: People over deadlines
Lunch included (also vegetarian/vegan options)
Paid parental leave
Competitive salary
And a Few Notes On How We Work
We experiment a lot and it doesn't always work out, but we always learn something
Everyone at the studio is hands-on and part of making things
You are part of defining and prioritizing your own tasks
You get to be part of shaping new projects and the studio
We explore and try to push the boundaries of what comedy can do in games
Working in 14-day sprints in close-knit teams of ~6 people from different skill areas
Deadline And Start

As soon as possible, but we will wait for the right candidate.

While we currently work remote and the job would start out fully remote, we will be returning to our office at some point, so you need to be in or up for coming to Copenhagen, Denmark. We can of course help with that.

WHAT THE TRIBAND?

We want to make people laugh! We do it by making comedy games, being original, and taking chances. We recently launched WHAT THE GOLF? - a golf game for people who hate golf!

All jobs involve experiments, bad jokes, stupid ideas, silly physics, and failed prototypes. We work in Unity and almost everyone works in-editor and very hands-on, also if you do design, audio, or animation.

We are currently ~20 people of 6 different nationalities and the language is English. We put the people first and strive to create a great working environment and are generally looking for people who are not like us and who will challenge us and our way of doing things!

We believe that teams make games, not individuals - and we believe diversity makes for better teams. That's why we look for people who make the team better, instead of just who's got the most experience.

We are primarily looking for people with at least 2+ years of game dev experience but will be opening up more entry-level positions in the future.

Får du blod på tanden, når vi fortæller dig, at du skal være med på en vækstrejse, der kræver, at du kan holde på hat og briller? Kan du se dig selv som backend udvikler i et af vores squad, hvor du skal være med til at sætte nye standarder for, hvordan man bygger, bruger og anvender finansielle produkter?

Så skal du sende os dit CV og eventuelt blive backend udvikler i et af vores i alt ti squads.

A look under the hood - vores tech

Vores tekniske platform bygger på en eventbaseret microservice-arkitektur, hvor continuous og independent deployability er et must med omkring 1000 releases i måneden. Vi hoster vores platform i AWS og orkestrerer vores microservices via Kubernetes - og alt, hvad der hører til af Cloud Native-teknologier. Vores primære sprog er Go, men vi tror samtidig på “the right tool for the job”.

Hos Lunar gør vi tingene simultant. Det betyder, at vi i øjeblikket står over for en hæsblæsende periode, hvor vi skal bygge nordens nye 100% digitale bank. Fra et tech perspektiv betyder det blandt andet, at vi hele tiden skal understøtte vores 200.0000+ brugere både i forhold til vedligehold, kvalitet og optimering af nye produkter samt introducering af nye.

Din elevatortale

Du har drive og lyst til at arbejde med software i en organisation, hvor kun du selv sætter begrænsningerne. Samtidig er du ikke bange for at smøge ærmerne op og give den en skalle. Du vil gerne være med på et hold, hvor jeres mål er at levere verdensklasse oplevelser til vores brugere.

Dine ambitioner er høje, og du elsker at blive udfordret i din dagligdag - både af dygtige kolleger og spændende problemstillinger, som du skal finde en genial løsning til. Du vil gerne være mede til at bygge robust software, og dine interesser og kompetencer ligger inden for backend udvikling, og du vil gerne være i en organisation, hvor du har mulighed for at bruge disse.

Hvad vi er på udkig efter

Hos Lunar er intet typisk, alligevel har vi en ide om, hvordan en “typisk” kandidat i denne stilling kunne se ud. Vi ser gerne, at du kan krydse flere ting af listen.
Har 3+ års erfaring fra en lignende rolle - branchen er underordnet.
Har en uddannelse inden for Computer Science fx. Datalogi, Ingeniør m.m
Stærke kompetencer inden for kodning
Elsker at bygge distribuerede systemer i stor skala
Har erfaring inden for; Go, microservice arkitektur, messaging, Docker og Kubernetes
Måske har kendskab til; event sourcing, Grafana, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, design og udvikle sikker systemer.
What’s in it for you?
Du kommer til at sætte dit præg på Nordens nye digitale bank, og din daglige gang bliver på vores lækre kontor i hjertet af Aarhus.
Faglig sparring med knalddygtige kolleger og gode udviklingsmuligheder.
Uformel tone, masser af grin og højt til loftet.
Du bliver en del af en iværksættervirksomhed, som oser af drive, og som har en fantastisk holdånd. Sammen har vi allerede opnået flotte resultater, og vi er slet ikke færdige.
I Lunar lægger vi vægt på at følge op på de ting, vi laver, så vi hele tiden lærer hver især og som team.
Vi går op i, at vores medarbejdere har det godt. Vi har en super lækker kantineordning, snacks to die for, fredagsbarer samt yoga og meditation på kontoret, padel turneringer, cykelklub og meget mere.
Vi elsker diversitet og alt det, der gør os forskellige - det er nemlig også det, der gør os nice! Nogle er ekstroverte - andre introverte. Vi taler ikke alle sammen dansk, norsk eller svensk til gengæld taler vi alle engelsk. Det vigtigste er respekt og forståelse - for selvom der er forskel på os to, så er vi gode venner, kan du tro.

Skal du gerne med på holdet?

Er du klar på at blive en del af en organisation, hvor der er fart på, hvor armbevægelserne godt må være store, og hvor du glæder dig til at møde ind?

459,Software Engineer • Backend (CPH),Lunar,"København, Capital Region, Denmark",4 days ago,"Do you have what it takes to be part of building the new bank of the Nordics? Do you have the brains, guts and team spirit to take Lunar to the next level? Are you ready to be a Backend Engineer in one of our first squads in Copenhagen while working with our tech superstars from Aarhus as well?

If so, then let us know you are up to the challenge by applying now

Squad, What? - our organisation

At Lunar, we work in squads. A squad consists of cross-disciplinary members who make up all the skills needed to complete the mission: developers, line-of-business, QA or subject matter experts. Squad members are handpicked throughout all departments in the company to ensure we achieve our missions.

The squad is fully self-driven and takes complete responsibility for what they create. Each squad has a mission and will stop at nothing to complete it. To do that they have the full empowerment and freedom to execute in any way they wish. It is in the squads the magic happens.

Currently, we have four squads in Copenhagen, each of them with a unique and important mission:
Voyager: Without Voyager, Lunar can not support customers.
Surveyor: Without Surveyor, Lunar can not use the power of advanced tech to fight financial crime.
Pioneer: Without Pioneer, Lunar can not scale with reason.
Rosetta: Without Rosetta, Lunar can not run a banking operation.
And this is just the beginning....

A look under the hood - our tech

We have built our internal technology platform on an event-based microservice architecture and have about 250 of them running. Continuous and independent deployability is crucial, as we release about 1000 times to production a month. We aim to be multi-cloud, but with most of our services running in Kubernetes on AWS. We love GoLang but honestly believe in using the right tool for the job: Python, JavaScript, or whatever else gets the job done.

At Lunar, we build the rocket ship while we race to the moon and beyond. To do that, we simultaneously expand our offerings and features while we maintain a solid, optimised and scalable platform for our more than 250.000 customers. It requires steady nerves and a super steady focus doing that.

Your elevator-pitch

You have the drive and ambition to develop software, where only you and your squad set the limits. You have a unique set of technical skills to add to the already impressive brainpower we have at Lunar. You are prepared to challenge the norms and know that the best argument is vital. You are a team player and not necessarily the rockstar that craves the lime-light but also enjoys being one of the unsung heroes backstage. Your focus is on backend development and maybe you have a passion for data and its usage. You have experience that you want to utilize at Lunar, but you also love to learn and grow.

So, what do we need?

About

Even though there is absolutely nothing typical about Lunar, we still have a pretty good idea of what a ""typical"" backender looks like
You have at least three years of experience from a role similar to what we are looking for - not necessarily from the same industry.
You have an education within Computer Science, Engineering or Data Science, or experience from ""the School of Life"" that is equal.
It is a must that you have experience with some part of the tech stack. That being Go programming, RabbitMQ, Event Sourcing, Grafana, Data engineering, GraphQL, Microservice architecture, or any other aspects that will ensure that the squad can complete the mission from a technical point of view.
You don't look away when somebody needs help, but you know when to interfere and when not to.
You don't take yourself too seriously and have an open mind.
What's in it for you?
You will have the unique opportunity to be part of building up not only the new bank of the Nordics but also the brand new Tech-hub from our excellent offices in central Copenhagen.
You will be part of a bunch of intelligent techies and ambitious financial nerds from whom you will learn from and grow every day.
You will be part of an informal organisation, where it is not the ironing of your shirt or your title that gives you the mandate to have an opinion but your arguments and passion for continually improving.
You will become part of a company that wants to make sure that you are well mentally and physically. This means that Yoga and meditation are encouraged throughout work hours, and if that is not your thing, we have padel tournaments, board games, cycling clubs and much more that you can take part in.
We love diversity and everything that makes us different from everybody else because that makes us extraordinary. We come from all kinds of backgrounds, and speak all kinds of languages, so English is our business language. Our most important value is respect and understanding because only with that mindset can we move forward with supersonic speed.

Are you ready to be part of the journey?

If you want to be part of Lunar, a place where passion and opinions matter, and we strive for nothing less than awesomeness, then get in touch with us, and become part of one of our fantastic squads.

If you have any questions regarding the position, please contact Head of Technology, Anders Kring at click apply, and he will try to answer your questions.

This is your chance to streamline software development tools through maintenance and development across teams in Software Engineering.

Join a leader in intelligent audio solutions and help your developer colleagues transform lives through the power of sound.

Help build Architecture & Development in Software Engineering

In Software Engineering, we are more than 160 colleagues – and growing in size due to an increased demand for our high-quality audio solutions. In this department, you will join and help build a brand-new team of 6 colleagues who will help streamline the way we work across all development teams in the midst of the Jabra growth journey.

The aim is to set the bar even higher for tools and architecture across Software Engineering, ultimately contributing to transforming lives through the power of sound.

Create and streamline tools across development teams

We are looking for 2 software developers for two brand-new roles. The two will form a small team within the team – the Tools team. We are open to different levels of seniority, and your role will be to create software development tools for the development teams in Software Engineering and also maintain the tools we acquire from outside the business. Moreover, we will also have an important role in training colleagues in the tools we choose to implement.

If you have several years of experience, we will also look to you to take on a more senior role of defining the requirements for the tools and prioritizing tasks. But regardless of your level of experience, you should expect to come across several programming languages – and get acquainted with as well as take over on multiple tools from several different teams.

“Our teams have had the freedom to choose the tools they preferred, but now we’re ready to streamline and work smarter to prepare for the future. Your challenge will be to choose and develop the appropriate tools – and that will of course also call for some adjustment in the teams as you help implement the changes,” says Morten Nielsen, Senior Software Development Manager.

This Is What We Are Looking For
You have an IT background and preferably broad experience with various programming languages – and the willingness to learn more
If you are a junior profile, we will furthermore be looking at the amazing grades on your certificate
You have experience with both object-oriented and procedural programming languages
You have experience with configuring and maintaining development tools
You are fluent in English
From C to JavaScript, from Jenkins to Git – you will definitely work on a broad palette of tools and languages. It will require your ability to understand and work on existing code and take responsibility of it moving forward.

This is your chance to streamline software development tools through maintenance and development across teams in Software Engineering.

Join a leader in intelligent audio solutions and help your developer colleagues transform lives through the power of sound.

Help build Architecture & Development in Software Engineering

In Software Engineering, we are more than 160 colleagues – and growing in size due to an increased demand for our high-quality audio solutions. In this department, you will join and help build a brand-new team of 6 colleagues who will help streamline the way we work across all development teams in the midst of the Jabra growth journey.

The aim is to set the bar even higher for tools and architecture across Software Engineering, ultimately contributing to transforming lives through the power of sound.

Create and streamline tools across development teams

We are looking for 2 software developers for two brand-new roles. The two will form a small team within the team – the Tools team. We are open to different levels of seniority, and your role will be to create software development tools for the development teams in Software Engineering and also maintain the tools we acquire from outside the business. Moreover, we will also have an important role in training colleagues in the tools we choose to implement.

If you have several years of experience, we will also look to you to take on a more senior role of defining the requirements for the tools and prioritizing tasks. But regardless of your level of experience, you should expect to come across several programming languages – and get acquainted with as well as take over on multiple tools from several different teams.

“Our teams have had the freedom to choose the tools they preferred, but now we’re ready to streamline and work smarter to prepare for the future. Your challenge will be to choose and develop the appropriate tools – and that will of course also call for some adjustment in the teams as you help implement the changes,” says Morten Nielsen, Senior Software Development Manager.

This Is What We Are Looking For
You have an IT background and preferably broad experience with various programming languages – and the willingness to learn more
If you are a junior profile, we will furthermore be looking at the amazing grades on your certificate
You have experience with both object-oriented and procedural programming languages
You have experience with configuring and maintaining development tools
You are fluent in English
From C to JavaScript, from Jenkins to Git – you will definitely work on a broad palette of tools and languages. It will require your ability to understand and work on existing code and take responsibility of it moving forward.

Would you like to know more?

To apply, use the ‘APPLY’ link. Applications are assessed on a continuous basis, which is why we encourage you to send your application as soon as possible.

Why You Want To Work With Us

We are building a personalized music streaming service and are launching globally. We need you and your expertise to join us in improving and expanding the Moodagent services, enabling us to bring better music to even more people. Check out:

We have all the things you know and love: Music, Big Data, Microservice APIs, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Massively Scalable Systems, and an ever-flowing stream of delightfully intricate challenges of making these things come together as a whole. And great people on top of that!

About You

You hold a degree in Computer Science or something similar, and some of these topics should ring your proverbial bell: C#, Python, Docker, Cloud Computing, REST, Big Data, Document Databases, Disco, Dubstep, or Death metal.

You enjoy taking on challenges that have no easy solutions, in close collaboration with your colleagues. You know the right way to do things, but also when to deviate from the established paths in favor of more unorthodox solutions. You thrive in an environment where we plan but also change those plans whenever we learn something new.

The Job

You’d be working as a developer in one of our domain teams, focusing mainly on our internal and external REST APIs. Your preferred language of expression should probably be C# or Python. Knowledge of databases is a huge plus. On the other hand, the teams are cross-functional and comprise data scientists, musicologists, and everything in between. So you shouldn’t be afraid to apply any expertise you have to any task that would benefit from it. Or to dip your toes into new pools of knowledge.

We Offer
A position with room for growth
A diverse team of colleagues from more than 15 different countries
Friday bars, a summer party & holiday gathering (all covid permitting)
Social clubs including running, football, FIFA, board games & extreme knitting
Flexible working hours

Laptop of your choice
Endless caffeine to keep you jamming
